,,,,Buen teléfono,,,,,
,,,,Phone is cheaply made. I dropped the phone barely chufy and the screen broke this is my second phone has my first one the screen cracked as well. IPhones can survive a drop off a damn 10-story building but this Samsung phone can't even survive a two foot drop. It is a very sad and disappointing product from such a a so-called great company. Do not buy stay away from this phone,,,,,
,,,,"El teléfono esta totalmente despegado de la pantalla de la carcaza , pareciera que la pila esta inflada , requiero cambio ya que no tiene ni un año de uso",,,,,
,,,,Battery life.,,,,,
,,,,Este teléfono no es compatible con ninguna línea disponible en los Estados Unidos y no me sirve .,,,,,
,,,,fast delivery but it doesn't work with Sprint/T-mobile. The IMEI is not in their system. The phone goes back to the seller.,,,,,
,,,,last year's model has all good features,,,,,
,,,,Good phone,,,,,
,,,,Very responssive,,,,,
,,,,Not att user friendly will not purchase cell from amazon again. I'll go to manufacture.,,,,,
,,,,When I order this there was nothing said that it could not be activated by my carrier due to the fact it was an international set and not supported by my carrier,,,,,
,,,,No Network Connection 1 day after refund/return window closed. Product was definitely defective. Shouldn't need a new SIM Card reader after a month.,,,,,
,,,,Samsung always doing their thing. Love their products,,,,,
,,,,"Muy buen producto, superó mis espectativas y tiene un buen precio.",,,,,
,,,,Got it connected no problems so far,,,,,
,,,,"This was my first time (and the 2nd didn't fair any better) buying an unlocked phone from Amazon. I loved this phone, but it wouldn't work with Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, Spectrum or Cincinnati Bell. I would WARN anyone trying to do the unlocked phone thing to be VERY careful.",,,,,
,,,,Great phone so far. My daughter uses it for games and seems fast and reliable.,,,,,
,,,,"THIS PHONE CAUGHT ON FIRE. I TOOK THE BACK OFF TO LOOK AT THE BATTERY .The phone gave a popping sound. I drop it to the floor. It was burning up. My aide ran in my room. "" Quote (hurry let me take this outside it can blow up. }She got something to pick it up and went outside and throw it away on the concrete.",,,,,
,,,,I only use this phone to check work email because I don’t want company app on my iPhone 12. This Samsung phone is about 30 seconds slower than my iPhone 12. Otherwise it’s ok.,,,,,
,,,,When i get it i let you know then if i like it are not seem to me ever order i make to amazon past 4 months ever thing getting lost are delay for some reason.,,,,,
,,,,"For call, for message ,for video ,for music ,everything",,,,,
,,,,Purchased on February 3 20 and won't charge now three months,,,,,
,,,,Battery is really good . Long time,,,,,
,,,,Works great and love the pictures that is nice and clear in this celler phone buy it .I love it .,,,,,
,,,,Honestly nothing. Everything was.going fine with it until my guarantee ran out. Ive been having alot of problems charging the phone. And since a week not abĺe to charge it. Now im stuck with a 200$ phone that i cant used.,,,,,
,,,,Only received an empty product box with charger and sd card so a scam.,,,,,
,,,,"Samsung androids might be the best. Although it is not the Flagship ""S,"" the ""A"" is the best android platform I've experienced. The battery life is excellent, although my phone is fairly new (approximately 1month now). The resolution is excellent for it's current price. As is its sound quality. The aesthetic of Samsung's applications are very appealing.",,,,,
,,,,Dont get it,,,,,
,,,,"Buen producto con una buana calidad,y responsabilidad al entregar .",,,,,
,,,,Very good...I love the phone i dont normally like new phones with all the extra details hard for me to work but yes the phone is good the battery dont last as long as I'd like but It does last long.,,,,,
,,,,Good phone for the money if you don't want all the bells and whistles. Does everything you need and battery life is very good. Camera is decent,,,,,
,,,,Lo solicite liberado para enviarlo a otro país en la descripción no dice si es unlocked,,,,,
,,,,Very pleased with fast delivery and product...only spanish instructions included could be an issue with some,,,,,
,,,,My dad loves this phone . It’s a bit more modern for him with the finger print the back of phone which was an adjustment. But the phone has been great so far.,,,,,
,,,,I'm really excited about the phone but I've yet to use it because it doesn't have a regular sim card. You have to poke like a needle in a very tiny hole. I don't have that because of my ms and the way my hand shakes. I personally don't like sharp or pointy things around me. I'm going to order a needle and try it so it should be working soon. I like the sharpness of the images.,,,,,
,,,,"I hate this phone. I have nothing bad to say about the seller, it arrived quickly and is what was promised. However, I find this phone absolutely maddening and have wanted to throw it or drop kick it so many times that I've lost count. The most annoying feature is it's accidental touch protection. If you set the phone down, like on a table, and you want to use it, you cannot. It will not respond to touch unless you pick it up. There is a place to turn it off in the settings, but it still does this even after you tell it not to. It is a large, heavy phone and I do not always want to hold it, I should be able to set it down and use it, but no. Accidental touch is not something I've ever even worried about with smart phones. I don't know why they felt it was a necessary feature. I used a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge for four years and switching to this phone was painful. I'm comparison, this phone is a cheap pos. I really like the Google sky map app, it won't work on this phone. After about a month of use, it's decided it doesn't work inside my house. All calls are garbled and it drops most of them. It frequently loses connection to the network when outside of the home as well. I would give it zero stars if possible. I wish I understood the difference between the s model and the a model before purchasing because I would not have bought this phone. It's become so useless after a little over a month of use that I've broken down and spent the money for an s9. I would have just bought one in the first place if I knew how cheaply made this one .was.",,,,,
,,,,"One week after purchasing, the internal mic stopped working. I couldn't send voicenotes and when I made a call, the person on the other end couldn't hear me.",,,,,
,,,,Wasn’t compatible my company,,,,,
,,,,"The clock was wrong and I can’t put the alarm, the location not work properly was waste of money",,,,,
,,,,tres bon produit,,,,,
,,,,"Decent phone but not kid friendly. Charger port can be easily broken. Make sure it's not forced or bent, when plugged into the charger.",,,,,
,,,,"Product was exactly as described, arrived when it was supposed to & without damage",,,,,
,,,,Very nice phone,,,,,
,,,,Awesome device,,,,,
,,,,"I tried to give them a benefit of doubt until I turned on my ""supposedly"" new phone. There was still pictures on the drive, the charger they had with it was not one you connect to the wall, but they gave a cheap generic charger... There was no sims cards with it. I am going try to post some pics to show you proof.",,,,,
,,,,Perfect! Was for my grandma and it did the job.,,,,,
,,,,"Absolutely beautiful phone, brand new. Fingerprint reader is amazing and battery life is unreal 3 days plus.",,,,,
,,,,"I have had nothing but problems since I had this phone. I am in the process of trying to find me another one. It keep losing connections! I have been to the ""store"" three times to get it fixed. I had a hard time getting all my information to transfer from my old phone. It just stop letting me send or receive pictures through my emails. Now my bluetooth keeps going in and out. Will not stay connected. Still can't set up voice mail! It seems like it's there, but can't retrieve them. My first and last Samsung. Thank You",,,,,
,,,,"Screen kept going black and the camera took pics that looked like xrays. My mum just needed talk and text so that didn’t really bother us but screen blacking out constantly did, multiple people in the household tried to get it to work. Maybe just a bad one but my mum needs a reliable phone.",,,,,
,,,,It's a well balanced phone and came as advertised.,,,,,
,,,,This phone is slow as heck. it takes a while just for it to load the unlock screen when it is already turned on. having more than one app open in the background makes the phone freeze. the only good thing is the camera... and its not great.,,,,,
,,,,Love it! Great video quality and sound.,,,,,
,,,,It was a good price but it was tough to get going and then transfer all my data. I still don't have all of my voicemails.,,,,,
,,,,This phone is wonderful I would buy another before I travel. This phone was for my nine-year-old and it’s unbelievable it’s better than my iPhone 11 you can search the web and watch YouTube videos at the same time how cool is that.,,,,,
,,,,"My friends that have iPhones say the camera is much clearer on this model than theirs, it fits in your hand nicely.",,,,,
,,,,Orijinal,,,,,
,,,,"The phone itself was great, but it was only capable of 3G. It would not work for my purpose.",,,,,
,,,,Great inexpensive Cell phone,,,,,
,,,,They sent the wrong color which caused my daughter to go mental but other then that great phon,,,,,
,,,,Don't work good. ):,,,,,
,,,,Does not work in the US and is completely useless. This is a issue that should be in the main description of the ad. Not close to the end of ad. Very disappointed in Amazon and this phone,,,,,
,,,,"Quick delivery, no issue set up. Gift for son and he likes it. So far so good, will revise if any issues happen.",,,,,
,,,,phone number missing on sim card and no support from samsung,,,,,
,,,,Great phone just what I needed,,,,,
,,,,Nothing,,,,,
,,,,"After reading both positive and negative reviews, I took the plunge and upgraded from Android 4.4 phone to this one. The phone is impressive and I have no issues with the quality of the device. There is one issue though where it seems to turn off or halt, and pressing the power button doesn't do anything. It's happened twice in 2 months. The solution is to press the power and volume buttons and it reboots. Not certain if this is my error or not.",,,,,
,,,,"Produit abordable avec la qualité Samsung, garde bien sa charge, reçoit les dernières mises à jour",,,,,
,,,,This phone has very little memory. I am looking for another phone. Not happy,,,,,
,,,,"Does not work for Cricket wireless, do not buy if you plan to use it for Cricket. Also do not buy unless you are comfortable buying a used phone.",,,,,
,,,,Me gustó mucho y el envío fue muy rápido.,,,,,
,,,,It came looking great but its not 3g or 4g and it is not GSM too. So it was not usefull to me. So I feel the add is miss led. So becarefull with this one.,,,,,
,,,,WORKS GOOD,,,,,
,,,,"I have used Samsung phones for the majority of my life and they always perform, this one is perfect for the price just make sure to pick up a SD card, also I do not recommend hardcore gaming with this phone.",,,,,
,,,,Did not work with straight talk as advertised,,,,,
,,,,This phone is no longer compatible with ATT as of January 19th. The seller needs to update comments on compatibility. I am returning this phone.,,,,,
,,,,This product need more option with updating it system. Its run very slow.,,,,,
,,,,Brought and sent this phone to relative in Venezuela. Disappointed to find out that it did not include headphones.,,,,,
,,,,"This phone sucks, it will not connect to any internet and even when I try to use my phone service, it will not update anything and when I took it to see if I could get help with it they couldn't figure it out, I wont get this phone agian",,,,,
,,,,Not really well,,,,,
,,,,Ok Budget phone,,,,,
,,,,Worth the money,,,,,
,,,,Samsung Android phone you get what you pay for it gets the job done just understand the specs of the phone your buying don’t expect a flagship galaxy but a workhorse none the less,,,,,
,,,,I really needed a new phone and this was definitely worth the money.,,,,,
,,,,"This replaced an outdate Windows phone and allows me to get greater use from apps which can help in my job duties. Very7 Pleased with display, features, Wi-Fi, etc. Was a good price and was able to get it into service quickly without any problems. Felt it was a good choice. Also delivery was quick, no damage to t he phone or packaging. Very Pleased with this purchase",,,,,
,,,,Bien protegido y empaque sellado... Lo recomiendo.,,,,,
,,,,Package was broken.,,,,,
,,,,"Haven't had it activated yet, but have everything transferred from other phone. Pleased with the results.",,,,,
,,,,Well iv been trying to gey this pho e activate it and no carrier will do ot cause its locked not happy at all dosen't say that om the description other wise i wouldn't of bought it mow i don't knpw what to do,,,,,
,,,,Regular use...i like everything about it...,,,,,
,,,,Llegó en excelentes condiciones rápido y bien sellado excelente SmartPhone,,,,,
,,,,"Es para mi hijo haber que tal,hasta ahorita todo bien. Buen Samsung",,,,,
,,,,Best Buy,,,,,
,,,,This phone works well except the SD64 GB does not work and it tells me the card is corrupt and will not allow pictures to be taken unless you switch storage to phone.,,,,,
,,,,I love this phone!Nice and improved features.,,,,,
,,,,My cousin love it,,,,,
,,,,"Excellent purchase, this phone has met and surpassed the expectations.",,,,,
,,,,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy A10s phone in October of last year & after having it for about 5 years, all of a sudden I can't receive calls or call out. Now I'm just finding out that it's not from the US or under US warranty 🤬🤬🤬🤬",,,,,
,,,,I like my new samsongA10s,,,,,
,,,,The A10s is a very good phone. Definitely worth the price. Nice big screen close in size to most high end phones. Screen is good not perfect but very good. Scrolling is nice and smooth most of the time. Colors are good. Not the most capable phone but if you want something simple cheap and big this is the right choice. Speaker is probably the only thing I would complain about. Doesn't have the best sound quality. A nice pair of galaxy buds will fix that. Blue light filter could also be better. Great budget phone.,,,,,
,,,,Buyers beware. This phone is not meant for US consumers. I have t mobile and I bought this phone for my aunt who is in my plan. When I put the sim card in this phone it will do everything but give you 4g. The reason it will not give you 4g is because it's not meant to be used in United States.,,,,,
,,,,The phone stopped charging after a month and despite using different chargers it will not charge fully and the seller never contacted me back,,,,,
,,,,Garbage. Not coming on when I swipe and touch,,,,,
,,,,Red I love it,,,,,
,,,,"Dear seller I purchased a samsung Galaxy A10s unlocked phone, for my brother who lives in Philadelphia, he told me the when he switch his sim card over to the phone it asking to sign in to google account why this is happening, I bought him a Samsung Galaxy A20 unlocked phone before and it work perfectly when he switches over his sim card, for the A10s i really don't know why it not working when he switches over his sim card, it telling him to signed in to Google account could i get an explanation why this happening. Probably I'll have to send the phone back.",,,,,
,,,,my wife loved her new phone works great,,,,,
,,,,Had it for one month so far working fine.,,,,,
,,,,"El producto llegó en tiempo y forma, no hubo problemas de empaque o algo suelto dentro del mismo. Ha funcionado correctamente todo este tiempo y sus características fueron las indicadas en la descripción, ya saben que luego anuncian una cosa y llega otra.",,,,,
,,,,It is not an unlocked phone and does not work with any carrier!,,,,,
,,,,RAPIDO Y EN ESTADO,,,,,
,,,,Very good phone,,,,,
,,,,Very satisfied. The only draw back is the lack of a slow motion videoing capability.,,,,,
,,,,The finger recognition not so good. But love the phone..Arrived in great shape..an a bonus I received earbuds as well,,,,,
,,,,Worst phone ever slow can't put apps on my sd iui f I could I would want my money back,,,,,
,,,,Absolute trash. First it does not support any 4g LTE. Only 2G. Second it has that on a picture... Should i fly to europe every time i want to charge my phone???,,,,,
,,,,For my daughter. She loves it. My wife wants one also. Better than iPhone by a mile,,,,,
,,,,I love it,,,,,
,,,,"excelente dispositivo, funciona muy bien, el doble sim le da versatilidad",,,,,

,,,,"I have been through 2 of these phones now and they won't make or receive calls through straight talk..the KICKER is..ATT can't activate it either! Text and data work fine, but I didn't buy a tablet..",,,,,
,,,,Product does not work.,,,,,
,,,,The product was not factory unlocked as advertised. The IMEI number was not a recognized number for Sprint to use.,,,,,
,,,,Counterfeit,,,,,
,,,,My daughter is in love with this. Thanks.,,,,,
,,,,Este teléfono lo uso para mí trabajo de delivery de Amazon flex excelente,,,,,
,,,,Never used it because it never worked !,,,,,
,,,,Solo falto la charola para dual sim y auriculares,,,,,
,,,,"Screen froze after 3 weeks. During initial covid shutdown, could not contact anyone. Return time frame expired. Useless. Purchased 2nd phone, unlocked. Arrived used and locked. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! with this company. Returning 2nd one.",,,,,
,,,,"This phone says it's unlocked, but I've tried putting three different services on it and none of them are compatible. It's a nice phone and seems to run smoothly, but It's not compatible with any of the phone services I want.",,,,,
,,,,This phone does not work on any carriers in the U.S it sucks,,,,,
,,,,"I did not open or use the product. The package info is in Spanish and I speak English only, also the info seems to differ",,,,,
,,,,Returning this second time writing .,,,,,
,,,,Receive product and it seems like the product was opened. Found the phone on and without the protecting plastic cover.,,,,,
,,,,"This is a present for someone and it has not yet been opened, so I'm unable to rate it.",,,,,
,,,,I bought this phone for my brother and was planning on giving to him for his birthday since his phone no longer works. Excited to get the phone so I can a surprise him when I go to see him for his birthday and inboxing the phone increased my excitement. The phone is sleek and very easy to hold; until I went to set it up. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOURE USING IT IN THE US. The Phone I received (don’t know if they’re all the same) had NO OPTION TO SELECT ENGLISH AS YOUR LANGUAGE. It starts off with Spanish and has the drop down window to select your language of choice. However NO OPTION FOR ENGLISH. Even though the description says US + International and can be used on T-Mobile network. Plus it had a lot of positive reviews I figured I couldn’t go wrong. Please do not buy if English is your first/only language and you’re planning on using it in the US,,,,,
,,,,"Vale la pena por el precio, tiene buena capacidad y es rápido",,,,,
,,,,"Phone functions are good, but battery life is really bad i am lucky to get 12 hous in power save mode. Only issue is that, battery life. Expected more from a 4000 mah samsung. I bought this thinking i wouldnt have to go everywhere with a cord and my budget is the lowest. I would have priced this phone at 75.00. Battery is that bad.",,,,,
,,,,Really good phone works with MetroPCS,,,,,
,,,,"I ended up buying a second for my wife, the fingerprint reader can be a wee hit and miss. I recommend getting a screen protector and good case as the glass looks a wee thin. Visit a few youtubes for tips on how to get the most of the phone and reduce battery loss.",,,,,
,,,,"Love the size and quality of hi-def screen, reaction of smart screen. Dislike Samsung removing Smart View to interact with ither Samsung products. Lightweight, thin bodied product but feels and responds like a well made debivice. Definitely a value for the price.",,,,,
,,,,"El producto viene tal cual está en la descripción del producto, fue un regalo para mi papá y el está encantado con su nuevo teléfono.",,,,,
,,,,Great phone,,,,,
,,,,"Great product, it is a little slow and glitchy here and there. But still works, nice and sleek, gets the job done. :)",,,,,
,,,,If you are like me and uses your phone to capture your most valuable experiences don't buy this phone. Terrible camera quality. The phone itself doesn't respond quickly to wifi or any connection.,,,,,
,,,,PHONE STOPPED WORKING CORRECTLY AFTER ONE WEEK TRASH.,,,,,
,,,,"i bought this phone not realizing that it wont accept 4G and it is a fake phone, i want a refund.",,,,,
,,,,Finger reader don't work,,,,,
,,,,"Es gama baja, pero funciona súper bien.",,,,,
,,,,I bought used and I expected some scuffs or signs of use but what I didn't expect was a cracked screen.,,,,,
,,,,Battery life after ten months is trash. Doesn't hold charge when trying to see if can get replacement was told not US version and over 30 days that they are not going to do anything.,,,,,
,,,,The phone makes great gifts!! I bought four of them for gifts and the recipients are pleased with them!!!,,,,,
,,,,It is a good phone bought it for my dad cause his old one needed to go to the trash,,,,,
,,,,Great quality and fast shipping,,,,,
,,,,This phone is great. It made a lot of things easy for me and for the price you can believe it was worth it.,,,,,
,,,,I love this phone highly recommended,,,,,
,,,,Excellent,,,,,
,,,,"Won't download messages properly, only 3g as shipped(thanks for letting us know), can't hardly long on to any networks. Complete waste of money.",,,,,
,,,,"Works great, came with headphones and a tool to open the sim card slot. The headphones are a bit hidden in the box but there under the whit flap in the bottom. I have all Samsung phones (25 but who's counting) I use alot of them as security cameras.",,,,,
,,,,I love the product it works very well and easy to use so I was glad to have that product in my possession,,,,,
,,,,Tiene muy buena definición y es práctico.,,,,,
,,,,Searched for verizon phones and was sold a phone that does not work on verizon at all. Purposefully misleading then steal 20% to return it. Scam,,,,,
,,,,I like this phone battery life is fantastic. its dual sim card capable.,,,,,
,,,,Nice phone however the tray for the sim card could not open with the ejection pin. It was defective I had to find an alternate way to open it. I wasn't happy about that cause it took me almost an hour to open it.,,,,,
,,,,After 1.5 months the screen came out. This my first time to see that happen with any cellphone,,,,,
,,,,Its not verizon so i cant use this phone i payed yall $154 dollars for this phone and its not even verizon a need to speak with someone asap about my phone,,,,,
,,,,This phone works very well and I love the picture quality. The battery lasts a long time.,,,,,
,,,,Was stated as an unlocked phone whereas in fact received the phone as a locked phone. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.,,,,,
,,,,Fast shipping battery life 12hours,,,,,
,,,,"Excelente calidad, esta nuevo de paquete Muchas Gracias Amazon.",,,,,
,,,,"I don't know if the issues I'm having with this phone is due to the fact that it was used or if it's because the a10s is just not a great phone. The camera and the flash are out of sync. When I need the flash to take a picture the flash goes off before the picture is taken and the picture quality is not very good. My Galaxy s9 takes great pictures. Also, I have to tap on icons several times to get the phone to react. I'm going to return this phone and buy another s9. The finger print reader works fine, the battery life is very good, and the face recognition is functional. But the other issues make this a sub par phone in my opinion.",,,,,
,,,,I like the phone nice came with headphones charger usb and the prepaid SIM card unfortunately I had to return it since I was going to give it to my stepdaughter as a gift but she got a phone so I had to return it,,,,,
,,,,"I haven't yet checked out all of the features but so far, so good. A very good purchase I believe...",,,,,
,,,,Very good,,,,,
,,,,I liked everything,,,,,
,,,,"Love my new phone finger print reader works like a charm , battery life is very good as well.Face recognition dont work for me but i love it awesome.i would purchased it again.",,,,,
,,,,"just as I expected a quality phone, for a good price.",,,,,
,,,,"Everything about this phone is decent, but it's a bit slow. My main complaint is that, in order to encourage people to get higher end, more expensive models. Samsung seems to have made it so that if you record video, the audio and video go out of sync. It's obviously done on purpose, as older Samsung phones don't have this issue. Otherwise, this runs the apps I need for banking and social media just fine.",,,,,
,,,,Okay,,,,,
,,,,Don't know what happened but i received a box with no cell phone!,,,,,
,,,,"Phone battery and fingerprint reader are great, the problem I have with this phone is how slow it is. The phone's touch screen is horrible. I set an alarm and couldn't turn it off due to the faulty screen, had to reset the phone. The phone constantly lags when trying to play videos. Maybe I just got a faulty product? Sure I can accept that, but I find that hard to believe since a refurbished product is usually tested.",,,,,
,,,,"I had the phone for roughly 6 months and it worked fairly ok at first, then it started running slower and pretty soon it went to crap. I had problems with battery keeping a charge for long periods and it would get slower and slower every week, soon I couldn't download and had to keep cleaning it in order to do anything with it.",,,,,
,,,,Trouble getting used to it.,,,,,
,,,,"Si me agrado,me pareció fantástico y bueno",,,,,
,,,,"Do NOT buy this phone is horribly slow, even when you reset it or factory reset, it takes forever to open apps or to write anything. Extremely slow.",,,,,
,,,,"It is a great cheap phone but the only issue i had is that, even though it says US compatible, it does not work with Verizon net.",,,,,
,,,,phone came to me not working,,,,,
,,,,Great,,,,,
,,,,Descriptions says unlocked but when we got a sim card for my son the phone says it's locked,,,,,
,,,,Todo bien,,,,,
,,,,"This phone is sold locked, this raises concern it is a stolen phone! Why else would it be locked when paid in full? Stay away save the time of doing a return.",,,,,
,,,,When i got this phone it was what i would never expect it works great battery charges fast and runs down very slowy and i would reccomend you to buy it,,,,,
,,,,"the price is OKay, the quality is Okay, the response is a little slow.",,,,,
,,,,"Phone's default settings are in Spanish with voice assistant enabled. Once you get past changing those settings (not as easy as it should have been but definitely doable) the phone is awesome. If you're a Samsung user you'll probably like this phone, it really reminds me of the S8 with the fingerprint reader on the back. It was purchased as a gift for a non smart phone user & she loves it!",,,,,
,,,,"Paid full price for a new product, and the tamper seal was cut and taped over. I know it was done before shipping because there is sticker over the tape on one side.",,,,,
,,,,"Barely CAN$200 with taxes included, this phone is a steal. It has virtually everything you'd expect for a modern smartphone. Works quickly, has a moderate amount of stock space, the camera is decent; the one low-point may be the speaker which isn't that impressive. An improvement over its similar predecessor the A10, this A10-S includes a fingerprint scanner which works great, as well as an improved location for the speaker (on the bezel of the phone instead of on the back which was easily muffled) — yet, it's priced almost identically to its predecessor. I will say one thing, I first bought a ""defective"" A10S and had to return it for a replacement, but I wasn't even sure if it was a one-off defect until I bought another one which didn't end up having the problem. The issue I had was that the touch screen was less responsive along the side edges of the screen, so when I tried to press keys like ""P"", or ""L"", or the backspace button it didn't always respond to my touch. The top pull-down menu also didn't work when the phone was flat. I thought it might have just been something I had to deal with because of the economical value of the phone, but it WAS a defect. If your A10S has this problem, return it for another one because that's not supposed to happen. Overall, if you're not someone who needs to have the latest most expensive Iphone and just needs a good phone that works and has all the features you need.... save yourself about $800 and buy this phone. It's an excellent value.",,,,,
,,,,"for the price, you cant go wrong",,,,,
,,,,Es muy buen telefono. Funciona muy rapido,,,,,
,,,,I WAS RETURNING NOW DID WANT TO PAID I TOOL U WHEN I RECEIVED IT,,,,,
,,,,Arrived on time! Works great. Takes awesome photos and video. Thank you.,,,,,
,,,,"Its beautiful, new and just worth it 👌",,,,,
,,,,I can t switch my phone number over to the new phone. I use they want the SIM CARD CODE I HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE for it. Please help,,,,,
,,,,It's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you very much.,,,,,
,,,,I did not have it long before the microphone went out on it. I had to put it on speaker when I received or made a call. The return policy from amazon was great.,,,,,
,,,,I thought this would be a great buy because of Samsung other products. This phone was not user friendly. The text message photos would not download. It kept saying there was an experation date. I tried to deal with it but ended up getting another phone.,,,,,
,,,,"Waste of money no good,",,,,,
,,,,I like the phone but it came in Spanish cuz wen i turn it on it starts talking in Spanish and i dont know how to change it i cant read anything in settings,,,,,
,,,,New phone works fine just doesn't connect with my network. I realize the COVID virus is a big problem yet I returned this item weeks ago and have yet to see my refund.,,,,,
,,,,"A pesar de que llegó a tiempo, tardó 3 días en salir la guía desde que se generó pero cumplieron con la fecha promesa. Es el segundo equipo que se compra, el anterior salió muy bien en la calidad de las fotos tomadas y duración de bateria",,,,,
,,,,This item was block it wouldnt work.,,,,,
,,,,I don’t recommend this product… I’m very dissatisfied,,,,,
,,,,"Came preloaded with some kind of random app that has access to everything and can't be uninstalled, if you value your privacy go elsewhere",,,,,
,,,,Good,,,,,
,,,,"I had already purchased this phone and was very happy with it and would have given it 4 stars (camera is just OK) but I dropped it and the glass was shattered. I clicked on the ""buy it again"" button on my order page expecting to get the same phone. I did not. It looked the same but there were important differences. The first clue that something was wrong was the adapters in the box which were not compatible with any electrical outlet I have. Next, after transferring all my data I noticed several unusual things. Any app that spoke had a british accent (which I didn't mind, but seemed odd). My weather app is set to 24 hour time and no matter how often I change it to 12 hour, it always reverts back to 24 hour. The dates on my email are listed as day/month/year so that March 20th would read 20/3/20. I then discovered an insert in the instructions informing me that the phone was from India and should be activated with a sim card issued in India. If I used a sim issued from another region the phone might not function properly. I live in Pennsylvania and that is where my sim card was issued. I called customer service, explained the situation and they sent me a new phone, assuring me that my experience was a mistake that would not happen again. My 2nd new phone came, again with the weird adapters and sure enough, a card that said the phone was an Indian phone to be activated with a sim card issued in India. That phone is also going back and I have ordered a completely different phone. Read the phone description carefully before purchasing. If it says International phone, do not order it!",,,,,
,,,,"It looks nice, but horrible awful video and camera quality. So much worse than I expected and my expectation was already low.",,,,,
,,,,Buen teléfono y a buen precio.,,,,,
,,,,I love my new phone.! Truly worth the price and more.,,,,,
,,,,Shipment reach quickly,,,,,
,,,,"Many dual SIM phones have only two card slots, one for a SIM and one that can be used for either a second SIM or a microSD card, but not both. This phone has three slots in its card tray, two for nano SIMs plus a dedicated microSD slot, so no sacrifice is necessary. Has an FM radio chip and includes wired ear buds to use as an antenna. Minimal bloatware, only thing I'd like to delete but can't is Facebook. Flashlight is super bright but only has one brightness level, 100%, unlike my previous Samsung which had four. No magnetic compass sensor, which is no biggie with GPS or if you can determine heading from the sun, moon, and time. No NFC so no support for contactless payment. Speaker location on the bottom edge to the left of the Micro USB port is unfortunate... my natural operating mode is left handed using the thumb to type and little finger to balance the phone, which blocks the speaker. Speaker is also blocked if I hold the phone against my body to stabilize. Speaker is plenty loud and sounds great. Wish it had a USB Type C port and quick charging capability. Display is very sharp, plenty bright. Software supports pretty much any language on the planet... at first turn-on, Español is the default, so pull down to US English if that's your preference. Easy peasy. No problems getting it to work on Metro by T-Mobile... just have to register the IMEI through one of their flirty customer service call center reps, who will waive the $15 fee if you go that route instead of taking it to a store. Had I asked for her number, she probably would have shot back with 611 LOL! Anyway, love the glossy red finish. 2 GB is a little light these days, but I've always used lower end phones so knowing how to minimize RAM footprint is second nature. No problems yet. Overall, not disappointed. I would buy again.",,,,,
,,,,"Great features, Good price and timely delivery.",,,,,
,,,,Todo bien,,,,,
,,,,"This phone is meant to be used in Mexico, if you live in the US it will not work at all unless you toss it on your wifi. It also stopped charging after 2 weeks. So yeah it's going back this person should be ashamed of themselves for peddling this fraudulent phones.",,,,,
,,,,"Large Screen and total perfection!!! Works just as good as the Big competitor at a fraction of the price!! I love the screen size, the fingerprint reader and Everything about my new phone!! Because it comes ""unlocked"" I was able to get a Really good deal on an inexpensive plan that also works the same as an expensive one from the big names!! This phone uses hardly any of the battery after a full day of texting and a few calls and several games of Soduko, I still have 89% of my battery juice!! Love this beautiful phone!! Thank you!!!",,,,,
,,,,Very disapponted purchased only 4 months ago and suddenly wont make calls or texts was working fine loved the phone went to bed and it just stopped very dissapointed,,,,,
,,,,Been pretty good so far. Crashed once on me but restarted and works fine. Camera a little tricky to get use to. In all a good solid phone,,,,,
,,,,"Double sim feature blew my mind. This is a great bang for your buck, works well with Koodo + Public. Get off of kijiji and grab this phone. If you're looking for something great for games and running thousands of apps, probably not the best for you. Its pretty big phone as well, bigger than the s8 for sure.",,,,,
,,,,Several issues with not being able to send or receive calls and text messages or access voicemail. Happens sporadically.,,,,,
,,,,"You sent me a Galaxy A10s and it not include a SIM card or tool to open the phone. I am not happy with that situation. I have never bought a cell phone that didn't include the SIM card. Worse, this was never pointed out so I could order one and I had to deal with that after I received the phone.",,,,,
,,,,"On time, and well works.",,,,,
,,,,Fácil de usar,,,,,
,,,,This unit allows both SIMs that I use to be in teh same phone. The memory expansion with the SD card makes the phone a good music provider.,,,,,
,,,,"Phone screen resolution and image quality are great for the price. However, the system is very slow when making a phone call. Moreover, Touchscreen and virtual keyboard are not accurate. For instance, when touching an app icon on the main screen, it often goes to the icon listing page instead of opening the app itself. Same thing for folder apps. Most of the time, when typing, you get the beside letter or no letter instead of the chosen letter on the virtual keyboard. When away from wifi, you need to activate the second sim card to activate mobile internet.",,,,,
,,,,Reliable but too light,,,,,
,,,,"BEWARE - Deceptive advertising This is advertised as an unlocked phone, but in reality it is not. It only if you have AT&T or T-mobile. I am sending back the phone and accessories. The phone has wonderful features and is very well priced. I wish that I could have kept it. We have our plan with Version.",,,,,
,,,,"Bought this for my son since his phone was getting pretty beat up. Switching a Tracfone sim was great and no problem. He is thrilled with the upgrade from his old phone, and so far everything is working great!",,,,,

,,,,nice phone,,,,,
,,,,"This is the 3rd cell i bought and like this one the best for price...Returned the other 2..THe battery tho does not last long(1 day of just using phone and text,not that much either) and find it hard to believe its 4,000 mah.If i played games or watched videos it would be dead in 1/2 day i would guess.Pictures are decent enough for me....I live in the usa and had no problem with my carrier puretalkusa(all there CS is in USA INEXPENSIVE AS WELL) when they walked me through setting it up....Dont use fingerprint or face recognition so cant comment on those.",,,,,

,,,,I like the double sim feature . I travel and I want a Canadian sim and a foreign sim available at all times .,,,,,
,,,,"When I called Samsung for support, they didn't even have the model or EMI number reg as being a Samsung phone. After 52 minutes on the phone with support they said it must have been made in a country such as Mexico and he could not resolve the issue. He said he would send it to another tech who would have a resolution in 3-4 DAYS. NOT happy, do not buy a phone on AMAZON, no matter what they say in the description about being unlocked...",,,,,
,,,,Super slow. Not happy. Trying to return.,,,,,
,,,,Wow very good phone,,,,,
,,,,It’s cool,,,,,
,,,,No problem getting this phone up and running. Has almost all of the functions as my S9 except for old and slower charging adapter connector. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this phone. Looks brand new.,,,,,
,,,,Perfect!,,,,,
,,,,Very good Product as I have a Note 9 and now my wife has the A10s Now,,,,,
,,,,Works great,,,,,
,,,,"Pues bien, no es un producto caro.",,,,,
,,,,"This phone is really nice and fast, but seems to have that camera issue I keep hearing about from samsung's. I did everything samsung said to fix the camera not working properly and still nothing. Camera will not let you take a picture unless you are in a App and do it that way like through messenger. Aside from that its a great phone, but I cannot give it more stars with a fisher price quality camera.",,,,,

,,,,Perfect for my intended use,,,,,
,,,,I dislike this phone. Why doesnt it have front flash? Camera on a whole is poor,,,,,
,,,,i love the size of the phone i bought it for my 56 year old dad for his Christmas however it was a lil difficult to set up in terms of the different features i would imagine someone who is not technologically savvy having difficulties setting it up had issues with the touchscreen too,,,,,
,,,,I think think phone is just as good as the S(version) and Note phones.,,,,,

I'm extremely disappointed since this phone is completely unusable I just wasted money. You would think that the seller would include the password so that it would be usable as a phone instead of a doorstop !",,,,,
,,,,Personnel,,,,,
,,,,Ok,,,,,
,,,,Good product,,,,,
,,,,my mother loved the product it was a Mother's Day Gift,,,,,

,,,,I just used it yesterday seems everything ok,,,,,
,,,,"We live in the US and used to spend a lot of time in Canada before the border closing so I wanted a phone that I would be able to use in the US and Canada using two different sim cards, one for each country. This is exactly what I needed and want. I like everything about this phone and have no complaints. Great value, brand new, fully functioning phone. The larger screen size is helpful and the phone fits my hand well. I bought a phone cover and screen protector and added a large memory card and this phone handles all my on the go computing and communicating needs. As soon as the US/Canada border opens again I'll love it even more.",,,,,
,,,,"I bought 2 pieces, one was intact with a seal the other had no seal and no accessories. All were the same price. I don’t quite get why one was opened and with no charger.🥺",,,,,
,,,,I've owned a similar cellphone before. No issues. I purchased it for a friend,,,,,
,,,,I loved the phone until I called my carrier and they said this phone is un able to activate due to the access of miem number,,,,,
,,,,Didn’t realize the S meant Spanish. And the voice to text was on. It took a while to interpret the language and be able to turn off the text to voice. Other then that the phone is alright.,,,,,
,,,,Phone and instructions was in spanish.,,,,,
,,,,Yes,,,,,
,,,,I can not hear anything on those phone after 1 month time. The audio is crapp,,,,,

,,,,"Arrived early, girlfriend loves it, would buy again!",,,,,
,,,,The worst Amazon purchased product. This cell phone used and buggy as can be It still has the security pass code from the previous owner which prevented me from geting into the phone. Then I tried to do a factory reset using procedures from Samsung and wouldn't engage. The phone isn't working and I will be sending it back.,,,,,

,,,,I like the speed that it was delivered and the appearance of the phone. Thank you,,,,,
,,,,This is a good phone and I enjoy it quite alot... no complaints at all,,,,,
,,,,I purchased this phone as a birthday gift for my father. He's been using it for a few months now and he loves it. It's fairly simple to use and it was actually fun teaching him the new technology in them like the fingerprint reader and facial recognition.

,,,,I like tho this phone but best one is yur delivery . I like amazon and samsung product thank you,,,,,
,,,,The description Never said this is an International phone. Can't be used in the USA nice phone though . Bad experience. It was really bad for me because I REALLY liked the phone. In the future be more specific in your comments on the phone. Mention that is an International phone. That's why I gave 1 star... I couldn't do 0 stars.,,,,,
,,,,Phone was locked and could not be activated.,,,,,

,,,,Excellent in all 3 attributes as advertised.,,,,,
,,,,Nice celephone. Face recognition,,,,,
,,,,I had to return this phone. Not by fault of the seller but because my stepson picked out the wrong type of unlocked phone for his cell carrier. It would not work with Tracfone. It was a nice phone. It arrived brand new. I'm guessing it wouldn't work because it wasn't the US version but an International version. They refunded my money with no problems! Thank you!,,,,,

Then the return process for the replacement was more difficult then I'd like. I'm currently waiting for a ups driver to pick up my phone when I could have just returned it with the other one to Kohl's. Absolutely no kohls drop off as an option and even though amazon gives you a time window for the ups man to arrive ups does not give out time windows whatsoever. Huge discrepancy there. As a consumer I am not happy with amazon nor am I happy with UPS. This isn't my first issue with Amazon and personally I'm beginning to feel that Amazon sucks and I'm about to choose to live without that convenience since it's no longer super convenient. They have absolutely no discourse as to when these issues arrive, no sympathies for their mistakes no sorry for the inconveniences here a percentage or a coupon, a month free for your loyalty to make up for our booboo nothing just a big fat eff you. So if you don't need me then I'll be goin",,,,,
,,,,Just as described but a little slow. I had to change the language to English and the phone has no wifi calling.,,,,,
,,,,Battery life is excellent. Phone stays it goes off by its self I have not tried the fingerprint and now that I'm trying the finger print sensor is not working! They asked for my address said they would send a new one up to this day they can't.,,,,,

,,,,"It's a really bad phone, don't waste your money on it, save up a bit more instead and get from another brand",,,,,

,,,,Genial,,,,,
,,,,I like every thing about it,,,,,
,,,,No stars only hit 1 star becauseit made me. Box not in English at all and will not hook up to any providers around Florida.,,,,,
,,,,"Advertised the camera as very well quality, very slow, and overall is not really a good phone.",,,,,
,,,,Ear speaker stopped working after a less than a month. If i want to listen to a call it has to be on speaker phone.,,,,,
,,,,"Overall the phone feels very cheap and loads slowly. The biggest problem though was that it is a 3g umts phone, which means it did not recognise my verizon SIM card. Product has been returned.",,,,,
,,,,Perfect,,,,,

,,,,"Not compatible for US cellular, who's been my provider for 6 years! Sucks",,,,,
,,,,I like the upgrade of a phone I chose however I'm mad that it didn't already have the nano micro SD card to come with it.,,,,,
,,,,Fonctionne parfaitement avec Bell à la carte. Mise en marche simple et rapide.,,,,,
,,,,I can't really review the item as the box was empty when I received it. The Amazon box was perfectly fine but upon opening that box I noticed the box that was supposed to contain the phone was awfully light and the seal was broken. I opened it and the oy thing in the box was the block that plugs into the wall to charge it.,,,,,
,,,,"Good basic phone, a little slow when multiple apps are opened, but really good value for money.",,,,,
,,,,EXCELENTE,,,,,
,,,,Will not work on Verizon network. My first time use Amazon and my LAST time I will use Amazon. Not refunding the money is the same as stealing. Being a theft is why I will never use Amazon again. No Star for Amazon,,,,,
,,,,Amazing Phone idk why there's bad reviews.,,,,,
,,,,Ok.,,,,,
,,,,"No trabajo muy bien, solo como por 3 meses y ya no se puede contestar bien las llamadas entre otras fallas.",,,,,
,,,,How can I get a refund? This phone only works in India! The description clearly states it works in the United States with art&t,,,,,
,,,,What i paid for. No issues,,,,,
,,,,"Internacional users, don’t waste your money. 3 months after purchasing the Samsung A10s Unlocked for International use from Lifeline786, the phone isn’t working properly. The screen goes black, doesn’t let you do anything, until it ran out of battery then it could turn back on right after charging it or take a day or two to start. Seller said after the 30 day warranty they offer the window is closed with them. Then if you are outside the USA (main reason why you buy this type of phone) the manufacturer “may or may not cover the Warranty”. Seller didn't offer any type of help to get the problem resolved/fix/repair considering have been only 3 months since it was purchased. After 30 days you are OUT OF LUCK. WHAT A WASTE.",,,,,
,,,,GOOD PHONE,,,,,
,,,,"Llego antes del tiempo, bien empacado. Completamente nuevo y sellado.",,,,,
,,,,I received my phone in 2 days! For the price you can't beat it. I have zero complaints. The phone is brand new and no signs of wear. Super clear screen and battery life is good. I have metro pcs and it was very easy to set it up with customer service.,,,,,
,,,,"Cheap, but wimpy. Dropped it once with a case, and the glass cracked.",,,,,
,,,,NOT UNLOCKED FOR STRAIGHTTALK IN THE USA,,,,,
,,,,Great battery life,,,,,
,,,,El telefono no me ha llegado y sigo esperando...,,,,,
,,,,"Bought 2 phones for daughters. One phone works perfectly. Great finger reader. Good battery life. Nice screen. Other phone had good battery life, finger reader works. About a month, the phone had vertical lines that started showing up on dark/black background screens. The seller tried helping fix this problem by suggesting things to do. In the end he helped get a full refund for the one phone. Fast responses, no issues with the seller. Seller was great.",,,,,
,,,,This is exactly what I ordered and for that price you really can't go wrong. The best part is it is factory unlocked so all I had to do was put in my old sims card and voila. You really can't go wrong with that price.,,,,,
,,,,Great phone just wish it had all cell phones company's,,,,,
,,,,No servia bien el touch en las orillas del teclado pero no tube problema para regresarlo,,,,,

,,,,Phone does not work already,,,,,
,,,,It's okay 👌,,,,,
,,,,"No me agado El equipo no funciona,no me permite uilizar INTERNET. GRACIAS",,,,,
,,,,"Product is for Indian market. Comes with European outlet adapter. Phone has Indian apps pre installed. It'd be fine if the seller would mention it in the description but they don't, at all.",,,,,
,,,,"It's a decent phone, after a few months the front camera on mine and my husband's phones became extremely blurry. Changed all the settings, reset and everything, nothing helped. Phone life is average, probably wouldn't buy another one.",,,,,
,,,,Not compatible with Verizon,,,,,
,,,,"Don't use the fingerprint reader, head problems with the face recognition, but I heard there is an update to fix that. Battery life is good.",,,,,
,,,,It's a good phone. My only real problem with it is the touch screen is too sensitive,,,,,
,,,,Very fast processor and so much memory. I love the size and picture quality. I can take great pictures and videos like a professional now thanks to the self stability.,,,,,
,,,,Don't waste your money broke after 8 weeks,,,,,
,,,,It stopped working after a month. Buying refurbished is risky.,,,,,
,,,,"I love my new phone, the only thing was it didn't come with the sim card like it said it would but it was a quick and easy fix. So overall it was all good.",,,,,
,,,,The person receiving this was very happy,,,,,
,,,,My carrier couldn't active,,,,,
,,,,It is a little slower than most phones.,,,,,
,,,,Waste of money. Battery not charging out of the box. No good.,,,,,
,,,,"Por el precio no se puede pedir mucho más, 32gb de almacenamiento, un procesador y ram suficientes para cosas básicas, una pantalla brillante, de tamaño generoso y nítida (en relación con su precio), acabados correctos, dual SIM, jack para audífonos, no está lleno de bloatware y se mueve de forma fluida, no es un s10, así que no se puede comparar, este es un celular de gama baja.",,,,,
,,,,This phone has a mind of its own none of the settings stay for long go what I set them to. Freezes turns off it just sucks,,,,,
,,,,Phone only connects to internet via wifi. I do not recommended this phone to anyone,,,,,
,,,,Terrible phone please don't waste your money. I promise and trust me I took a second chance and bought twice and none of them lasted more two months,,,,,
,,,,I couldn't get my facial recognition to work good but that could be cuz I'm ugly,,,,,

,,,,Pesimo lo pedi el 19 y llegaba el 23 y no e recibido nada aun y ya lo marcaron como entregado y no me dan una solución no lo compren,,,,,
,,,,The phone was obvious used previous. There were a ton of Hispanic bookmarks in IE and the phone was auto set up to Spanish. Also this phone was not compatible to straight talk even thought it said it was. I spent my entire sunday trying to get my phone switched over only to be told the phone wont work with striaghtalk Worst experience I've ever had buying an amazon product!!!! If I could give it negative starts I would,,,,,

,,,,It was sold as an unboxed phone lots of trouble,,,,,
,,,,My son love,,,,,
,,,,i mean it works,,,,,
,,,,Its a type c port,,,,,
,,,,"Each cell phone is different, this one is no different, your preset apps are difficult to remove, some apps appear without permission and are impossible to remove. With no permission from me, it is irritating to know I have no controls that are easy to find. Watched several videos on troubleshooting this phone with little help. When the cell phone was reset evidently microsoft put on new apps which are without my permission. My next cell phone will be well inspected prior to accepting it.",,,,,
,,,,Súper,,,,,
,,,,"I love the product and the time in which I received it, it's alsome!",,,,,
,,,,Excelente Gracias,,,,,
,,,,No English Instructions so i refused to keep the phone.,,,,,
,,,,DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON NETWORK.,,,,,
,,,,Good phone,,,,,
,,,,Excelente,,,,,
,,,,I can not activated my new phone right now what can I do,,,,,
,,,,First one was faulty. Second ones seems fine..apps look different from my Note 9,,,,,
,,,,"I like the finger print recogition and the feature that you can add multiple finger prints, so I have both my left and right index fingers set up to operate the device. The phone turns on from the side, but also if you place your finger on the reader in the rear, which is a natural way to hold the phone, it's turns on right away. I haven't set up the facial recognition so I can't comment on that. Using the Samsung APP ""Smart Switch"", all my data and APPs transferred to the new phone. I did have to log back in to the APP accounts on the new phone, which was a good safety feature, in my opinion, in case someone where to do it without your knowledge, they wouldn't have immediate access to your information/accounts. I am very happy with this purchase.",,,,,
,,,,My mom loves it. Beautiful pixelation. In the outside cover of the phone is really vibrant.,,,,,
,,,,I like the battery life,,,,,
,,,,"Es un teléfono que para su precio tiene un estupendo servicio y rapidez, lo compré para un adolescente y está feliz.",,,,,
,,,,first time trying to charge it and it would not charge,,,,,

,,,,It was a gift I made to my mother. But it Looks and feels good so far working perfect she's only had it activated for two days. Is a great phone for starters.,,,,,
,,,,I love phone hate that didn't come with a charger.,,,,,
,,,,"I bought this for my mum and didn’t read reviews first, I wish I had. Like everyone says it arrives with the default language to Spanish. It is not “unlocked” and does not work with AT&T.",,,,,
,,,,Like,,,,,
,,,,👍,,,,,
,,,,Excelente calidad y precio... totalmente funcional,,,,,
,,,,Got phone. It read my sim card. That's what I needed it to do. It came in Spanish. Had to switch it to English. Which was simple. It's a pretty big phone. Sends pixelated videos in text messages.. and the video has to be 10 seconds or less for me to send it..,,,,,
,,,,US Cellular store tild me they cannot activate this phone in America. Waste Of Money,,,,,
,,,,"Très satisfait, facile à utiliser.",,,,,
,,,,Buen precio y calidad,,,,,
,,,,"Just a few days after receiving this product the screen would go blank in the middle of sending a text message, surfing the net or on a call. Restarting the phone helps sometimes but sometimes not at all. I messaged the seller to ask why this was so but never got a response. So I am stuck with a phone that is not usable.",,,,,
,,,,En celular sencillo y practico funciona muy bien es rapido de acuerdo a sus capacidades,,,,,
,,,,The volume In my phone stop working less than 2months very angry,,,,,
,,,,Lags at time and can be slow.,,,,,
,,,,"Ordered a phone. The only problem, there was no phone in the box!",,,,,
,,,,no parece que sea renewed,,,,,
,,,,The phone is great and my brother has not complained about it at all.,,,,,
,,,,Good price but stopped charging a week after having. You get what you pay for never again.,,,,,
,,,,Instructions came in Spanish but overall satisfied with the phone.,,,,,
,,,,Don't buy from this seller had the phone for 3 months and it stopped working. I sent it to samsung they they wanted to charge me to fix it because you guys wouldn't take back the phone,,,,,
,,,,I like how everything worked as described.,,,,,
,,,,"For the price is an excellent device. I bought it for my father and he just loved. The fact that it’s DS makes it even more suitable for the reality of some countries overseas. It is also unlocked. The capacity plus the memory card gives plenty of space to have pictures, conversations and all of the things you may want to store. The face recognition set up is the thing that I found difficult. It worked very well on my face but for some reason on my father’s face wasn’t working. I just gave up on that. But we were able to add the finger print and you can add more than one.",,,,,
,,,,"So happy with this phone. Easy to use,and understand. Great battery life.",,,,,
,,,,bought this for a work phone no regrets at all,,,,,
,,,,It was not unlocked. It didnot meet my expectations,,,,,
,,,,"Came unlocked, with headphones, cameras (quality) perfect. I hesitated buying this phone because of the mixed reviews, especially about freedom mobile, who I had a plan with. Worked like a charm. And sure, it;s default language was Spanish. But, geez, just change the language settings to whatever. Very pleased. Granted, I still have to tweak it further to my preferences, but no regrets here.",,,,,
,,,,"I bought this product and their was no mention that this phone is in Spanish. It wouldn't change options, I'm very disappointed, and my phone matters just got worse.",,,,,
,,,,Says its unlocked but didnt say it wasnt for verison tower until i got the box and the sd card wasnt in there,,,,,
,,,,Livraison rapide et très satisfaite des articles. Bonne qualité aussi. Design joli et le téléphone est léger. Je suis hyper contente de mon achat :),,,,,
,,,,Awesome phone. Set up was easy and I have had no issues since with the exception of the memory card it came with. The card kept unmounting itself and has cleared all my data twice. So I threw it away. Initially I thought something was wrong with the card tray but I inserted a new memory card and I now have no issues.,,,,,
,,,,The imei doesnt match phone to set it up and if you do manage calls or txt data is absolutely unavailable!,,,,,
,,,,"Per the box, this phone was manufactured for India. I live in the SE United States. The only signal we could receive was the Edge network. It barely worked in wifi, dropped calls, slow connection... Why sell a phone if you're not 100% certain it will work in the area in which it's sold? I returned it and paid a little extra for a sure thing from my mobile provider",,,,,
,,,,"The audio is not good at all. People tell me they hear me as if I was speaking through a tunnel, and forget about using the speaker, it's even worse. Listening to someone speaking to me on the phone is an agony! And all the audio features are all in the correct setting.",,,,,
,,,,Love the phone! It was everything and more than I expected.,,,,,
,,,,I got this phone for my husband and he is so happy with it so far. When he turned it on it walked through nice and easily how to set up his phone. Thank-you so much. And it was also a good affordable phone as well.,,,,,
,,,,"This is my second Samsung galaxy a10S. They are great phones, I just happened to smash my first one, so I ended up ordering the same phone again. This time I recieved a Spanish version of this phone. Getting it set up was a pain but once I got it switched to English and my sim card worked I figured it would be fine. I'm a few weeks into using the phone and it is clear that this phone does not work as well as my previous phone of the same make and model. I contacted customer service in hopes I could get a replacement, but they said i would have to return this phone and order again. Right now I don't have a spare phone to use and can't afford to order another phone before I get my refund, so I'm basically stuck with this knock off. Just wish I got what I ordered",,,,,
,,,,Nice phone - Great value,,,,,
,,,,My teen is very happy about it,,,,,
,,,,Satisfait,,,,,
,,,,Sesiones de zoom es ta completó.,,,,,
,,,,This unit is in pristine condition the unit acts like the screen is being touched all over the place intermittently,,,,,
,,,,The product arrived on time. The phone is great. My problem is that I didn't get a Sim ejector pin. Not sure what happened to it.,,,,,
,,,,"Didn’t work. Said no sim, but the sim chip was in it. Sent back and still waiting on refund.",,,,,
,,,,It’s a good product I recommend,,,,,
,,,,It DOESN'T WORK WITH A VERIZON SIM CARD I wish it I read the small print,,,,,
,,,,"I purchased this phone to use in a bring-your-own-phone plan with a mobile phone network...it was a model recommended for a plan requiring WiFi calling. When the phone was set up, it did not function. In discussion with the technical support staff of the mobility network, I discovered that this particular phone is NOT supported by the mobile network available to us in our remote location. The recommendation was WRONG. Other Samsung models will work. I do not know the reason or source for the incorrect recommendation...Samsung or Fido network, but it doesn't matter...phone was returned.",,,,,
,,,,Will use every day until StraightTalk makes it obsolete...,,,,,
,,,,"Only problem was it was an international model and had to return it,seller refunded money.",,,,,
,,,,This product is not compatible with US cellular networks sending this back.,,,,,
,,,,I bought it for my grandson,,,,,
,,,,It was fantastic,,,,,
,,,,Phone arrived quickly and exactly as described.,,,,,
,,,,Not terribly expensive and had tons of room for everything.,,,,,
,,,,My husband loves it,,,,,
,,,,Me llego completamente nuevo sin ningún tipo de uso con cargador y audífonos y está desbloqueado para cualquier parte del mundo funciona la huella el reconocimiento fácil y todo me encanta! Fue un regalo para mi mamá,,,,,
,,,,Muy excelente celular,,,,,
,,,,"Totally great phone. Charges faster and works way better than my last motorola phone. Maybe I just love Samsung. I have a Smart TV, Active Watch, and now phone. Cant go wrong. Oh and I have cricket. $55 a month for unlimited data. Love this phone!! One very satisfied customer. All I did was is move my SIM card to this phone and transfer files from old phone.",,,,,
,,,,Phones speaker stopped working!,,,,,
,,,,Dropped from a moving vehicle and still working no problems,,,,,
,,,,This is a good looking phone nice display easy to use with nice graphics and storage however I took the phone to the three major carriers and none of them were able to activate it even though it was labeled as unlocked. On the box and in the information pamphlet indicated that the phone would only accept a SIM card in India. Why they are selling it here in the states is confusing but I was able to get a refund in a promt manner.,,,,,
,,,,very slow,,,,,
,,,,Está muy bueno,,,,,
,,,,Wasn’t compatible with carrier and phone was in a different language,,,,,
,,,,I haven't used the face recognition or the fingerprint reader but the battery life is excellent,,,,,
,,,,Buen teléfono no tan rápido pero por el precio esta bien para un adulto mayor que no exija velocidad,,,,,
,,,,The phone was as advertised for a good price. The only issue was the packaging was in Spanish so I had to go on line to get the set up instructions and other information you usually need with a new phone. All elese was great.,,,,,
,,,,"I like that this phone was truly unlocked and didn't have a problem activating it on my carrier. The only issue is that when I try to video call on WhatsApp , my phone powers off.",,,,,
,,,,"Disappointed. I loved my past Samsung phones and did my research on this model. Functions are limited for a phone in this price range: shutter sound on the camera can not be turned off, subpar camera (poor focus, blurry pictures, lag), the reception is awful (drops calls when my service is solid), lag when opening and closing apps. Generally a mediocre phone. Pros: light weight, seems rugged, good battery life, charges fast, has tons of storage.",,,,,
,,,,Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for my boyfriend. Hes a little rough with phones so we didn't want to spend a whole lot on a new one. It came in brand new in unopened box. The box had writing that wasn't English but that's the first thing you change when you turn on the phone so it wasn't a big deal. Was a little laggy at first but once all the updates finished it was fine. The sim card went in without any issue. All around everything was perfect and he loves his phone. For the price we can't be happier.,,,,,
,,,,"Very nice phone at a very good price, and it's unlocked for any GSM carrier. I live in Panama and it works perfectly with my provider here. It also updated immediately to the latest Android 10 software. Does everything I would ever need.",,,,,
,,,,"Arrived a week later than promised, and didn't connect to my network even though it was compatible to it",,,,,
,,,,"Good size, storage, color and easy to use.",,,,,
,,,,Not compatible through Verizon. Didn't receive calls of texts with ATT.,,,,,
,,,,That is a great phone for my price!!!!,,,,,
,,,,The phone was slow to respond and quite heavy. I returned it,,,,,
,,,,Good phone for a good price. My son loves it.,,,,,
,,,,"I got my phone 4 days ago. It was very easy to set up and change the language. So easy. The phone takes good pics. I enjoy pictures more because I enjoy memories, so camera is important to me. I downgraded from a galaxy 10 bc it shattered. But I really enjoy this phone. Great buy, and will buy one for my son for his birthday!",,,,,
,,,,Je lai acheté pour ma belle mere qui avait un dinosaure avant comme cell. Comparer celui ci est parfait. Fonctionne bien charge rapide. Toute fonctionne a merveille. Merci pour elle.,,,,,
,,,,Really like this phone wish it had came with a case I had to convert my iphone7 plus case as a temp case until I can get one but this galaxy a10s is a very good phone thanks Again guys,,,,,
,,,,"Battery lasts throughout the day. Would've been great if it would wake up by tapping the screen. Still uses that silly microUSB, so no USB C connector.",,,,,
,,,,Funciona bien,,,,,
,,,,Todo muy bien.,,,,,
,,,,I havent quite masterd a few of the features. But i love my new cell samsung has alwayz been the only brand i would buy.,,,,,
,,,,Was not able it use it with my phone company anymore,,,,,
,,,,This phone was so generic and so basic. Its processor was sk slow and facial recognition moved even slower to where it wouldnt even work. Many flaws.. it malfunctions to where the whole screen glitches and I have to reboot it. Very dissatisfied.,,,,,
,,,,Arrived on time and is a good quality phone!!,,,,,
,,,,Me encanta y el precio ni hablar,,,,,
,,,,"I got a brand new phone! Brand new headphones, charger, and a 64gb memory card! And it works in Jamaica—after all, it is unlocked as correctly stated! I honestly cannot complain about anything associated with this phone. It works, and that’s a blessing right there!",,,,,
,,,,"I wanna start by saying I LOVE the phone. However, I got the bundle with the sd card and it doesn't work. I tried talking to Amazon for help and it was horrible customer service. Didn't answer my questions, and was very demeaning. While I don't regret the phone, use that extra 8 bucks to get a good sd card so you can avoid the hassle. I'll be buying a new sd card soon 🙄",,,,,
,,,,Thank you,,,,,
,,,,The initial setup was somewhat complicated for older folks. The call function could be improved. On tapping the call icon one expects to see the keyboard numbers immediately. The appearance of the contact list is not as essential as the keyboard since one already knows the number for which the call is intended. The sound quality could be better. Its a bit squeaky. Otherwise the phone appearance is just fine. I am not technically savvy enough to comment further.,,,,,
,,,,The SD port was torn I couldn't log back into the phone fingerprint didn't work and the phone was slow only good thing was the camera,,,,,
,,,,Buen modelo por un bajo precio. Es lento y se traba bastante cuando tiene poco espacio en el almacén.,,,,,
,,,,This phone is so slow. I regret this purchase. Don't waste your money.,,,,,
,,,,Fonctionne très bien et livré en 3 jours,,,,,
,,,,Perfecto,,,,,
,,,,Arrived with “Do not accept if seal is broken” seal being broken & no phone within the package. External shipping box was not damaged and did not appear to be altered.,,,,,
,,,,"I wanted to use this phone as it arrived in fine condition, but T Mobile could not activate it because it is strictly an international phone. It says US and international and I was disappointed because it would have been perfect. I would like to order another if compatible with US network but can't get any response. Why import a phone that only works internationally?",,,,,
,,,,Very easy to set up and use.,,,,,
,,,,I like everything.i use it in my daily life,,,,,
,,,,So far good. Great phone.,,,,,
,,,,"Phone works great and compatible with Metro PCS. Phone arrived brand new in sealed Samsung box with charger plug, cable and earbuds.",,,,,

,,,,Perfect. Fast and secure delivery. Product works fine.,,,,,
,,,,It's compact and handy though the video quality is not very sharp,,,,,
,,,,Muy buen cel. Para su precio,,,,,
,,,,The warranty is NOT valid in Canada. The phone stopped charging after 3 months. Samsung will not do anything with this phone in Canada under warranty. What a scam.,,,,,
,,,,phone will not work with Verizon,,,,,
,,,,Good quality for the money spent.,,,,,
,,,,"Llevo aproximadamente 2, casi 3 meses con este celular. Todo va perfecto! Un telefono barato para la buena calidad que tiene. No se me ha presentado ningun problema (y se me ha caido como 3 veces por accidente pero ha resistido muy bien)",,,,,
,,,,"Buen teléfono de gama baja a media, buena relación precio beneficio, también de puede invertir un poco más e ir por los Xiaomi",,,,,
,,,,What I ordered and what was in the description was 2 different things.. the phone I received was locked and for international use only...returned the phone no problems!!,,,,,
,,,,"I purchased this phone for the express purpose of having a higher version of Android so that I could control two GoPro cameras and other video equipment that my trusty Galaxy 5 could not. I quickly found that it was in Spanish and no amount of trying, for more than a week, proved successful in changing the language. The initial Commence page totally failed to respond to any taps, tap and hold or swipes or system resets.. I eventually called Amazon Support and got a wonderful rep; unfortunately she could not resolve the issue. I was on the verge of returning the phone when one night it magically advanced to the first screen of set up, in Spanish. I am fluent in French so could understand some words and eventually advanced. The next stumbling block was Google insisting I set up a new G Mail account, with no opt out, and no way to use my current Google account. After several days I finally arrived at a screen where I could change the language. I was, at last, able to set everything to my preferences. Quite a very long haul but worth the effort. The phone performs exactly the way I wanted it to and there have been no more issues. I noticed other buyers have encountered language problems with the initial drop down ""Change Language"" failing to work. IF you have the patience and perseverance you'll hit your goal. Delivery was very fast, and, need I say I do not back off from challenges! Be aware: A10s [Spanish] A10e [English].",,,,,
,,,,"This item is not described correctly. In the description it says that this is a unlocked smart phone, and on the bottom of the box it says it’s a locked smart phone. When I tried to activate it with my wireless provider they confirmed for me that indeed it was a locked smart phone and they could not activate it. I would not recommend buying this phone. Will be returning it.",,,,,
,,,,"Good size, sharp screen, storage and color.",,,,,
,,,,The phone works great my only issue is the volume sounds funny when people are talking.,,,,,
,,,,Said I would work with boost mobile and it's only cricket,,,,,
,,,,He had an older phone that would not hold a good connection like this one. We are both happy about it.,,,,,
,,,,"Es bueno por el precio. Lo ùnico es que no encurntro como pasar archivos a la sd, parece que no se puede",,,,,
,,,,"This is a very good, fast-working phone and great if you're on a budget. The camera quality isn't the best, but the facial recognition and fingerprinting work well. Battery life is very good (after using it all day it's still at 60% when I get home). Uses micro-usb port though which there are not a lot of options for charging cables to buy. Came with headphones, charging cable and sooner than expected. Overall a great purchase.",,,,,
,,,,Phone will not connect to Verizon network. Inexpensive ok phone that only connects to wireless. Bad camera too.,,,,,
,,,,Love this phone!,,,,,
,,,,Works great so far!,,,,,
,,,,amazing,,,,,
,,,,Apparently good looking but broken. I needed to change the charging system.,,,,,
,,,,"Great phone, works great, good screen size",,,,,
,,,,So Far So good still haven't figure out how to use all the bells and whistles,,,,,
,,,,Excellent,,,,,
,,,,I just received the phone today and it will not charge no matter what cord/outlet I use. I tried to leave it connected to charge for the whole day but it does not show how much it has charged and will not turn on no matter what I do.,,,,,
,,,,The phone was a birthday gift for my daughter...I was offered a bundle that included a case and screen protectors! It was worth the wait and the price!,,,,,
,,,,well thought I got an A10S but got an A10e so nothing but hassles. to get running properly on Att. I would return it but sent it to my disabled brother to replace a lost phone. phone works but not on Data. have spent hours on support ... this was a pain,,,,,
,,,,Terrible purchase. First impression phone looks nice but it glitches. Loads very slowly. I cant activate it with my verizon account. Useless buy.,,,,,
,,,,Great for the money,,,,,
,,,,Great phone. Long lasting battery. Camera takes really good vivid pics,,,,,
,,,,But i couldnt downloed any app it has problem,,,,,
,,,,The phone works really great. I am using this since February. Did not face any problem at all.,,,,,

,,,,I bought it for my mother. It worked great. It was easy to configure. She is delighted!!!!!,,,,,
,,,,"My daughter loves this phone! Great features, camera is great; long battery life.",,,,,

,,,,"Je suis très satisfaite de ce produit que j'ai reçu dans les 24 heures de la commande. J'ai mis 3 pour deux points auxquels je ne peux répondre en ce moment puisque le téléphone est neuf et que je n'ai pas eu le temps de tout réviser. Ce que je peux dire c'est qu'il a été facile de l'activer, qu'il fonctionne très bien et qu'il a fait une personne très heureuse car c'était un cadeau. Finalement le téléphone a été activé et tout fonctionne à merveille.",,,,,
,,,,Good bang for the buck.excellent.camera,,,,,
,,,,"He recibido el celular pero al encender aparece mensaje App fallido, no responde",,,,,
,,,,"I dont like that the Camara stop working after 3 days and this is my second phone, seller did and exchange which was great but the same issue with second phone after 3 day camara stop working.. I really don't have the energy for this nonsense so I bought a camara app off google play store..",,,,,
,,,,very good cell phone,,,,,
,,,,Phone was in spanish and the screen was messed up...couldn't select anything. Poor buy!,,,,,
,,,,Buena calidad y excelente precio,,,,,
,,,,It was gift for my husband he was very happy,,,,,
,,,,Not really unlocked for all carriers I bought this wasnt compatible with the company I go thru..,,,,,
,,,,AT&T said it wasn’t any good could activate it that’s what the sells rep told me after about 2 hours of them trying,,,,,
,,,,Not the best camera but at least the price is good,,,,,
,,,,"The Galaxy A10S is quick,nice camera and looks great. Nice display and works awesome with a Bluetooth headset.",,,,,
,,,,"Absolutely the most aggravating pile of trash i have ever used. It's comparable to a defective Blu phone. I honestly didn't even finish updates before i knew i hated it. I will never buy a samsung again. Guaranteed. The price cannot be justified just because of the storage. I prefer using my broken ran over 50$ LG. The swyping is unforgivable, doesn't auto space in Google search, literally swypes words that words that doesn't exist in three English language, and oh yeah i checked and triple checked language settings spell checking. Now considering this is a phone.... i should be able to call and gave a conversation, that would be nice. However the ""sim card data has changed, device will reset automatically"" happens every 10 seconds to 2 minutes killing my service. Now. Even more embarrassing is the sound quality. Im talking my kyocera from 1999 DUMPS on this thing, so quiet sounds like only half the speakers work, they sound super chincy. Just cheap crap. On to Samsung customer service. Not good. Ima just leave it at that. Id rather blindfold myself and play in heavy high speed traffic than use this phone. I refuse to return that abomination,. it will be destroyed with 5 lbs of tannerite",,,,,
,,,,"Es un buen equipo, acorde a su precio.",,,,,
,,,,Good quality and it came fast,,,,,
,,,,I am disappointed that this phone was not brand new. No where in the description does it mention that is is a pre owned or USED phone. My phone already game with someone else's information TIMTHEGAMER204@GMAIL.COM. I would like some of my money back. Why would I pay full price for something that is used and not new? I purchase pre owned items often but not for the same price as a new item. That is absurd. As a seller you should be honest. You already know this phone was pre owned. List that so as a consumer I can make my proper decision. You should make this right.,,,,,
,,,,very good,,,,,
,,,,Buenos,,,,,
,,,,Cannot activate phone,,,,,
,,,,Do not buy if you have cricket will not work,,,,,
,,,,great phone,,,,,
,,,,Although this phone was nice when hooked up to wifi. It will not work on American Networks. And can't be used off of a wifi connection.I had to return it.,,,,,
,,,,arrived as expected,,,,,
,,,,"It freezes too much. Can't send more than 2-3 pics per text. Can't send video or audio longer than 10 seconds. Sends my screenshots & videos very blurry... My J3 Prime (4yr old phone) I replaced with this phone was capable of more. My Galaxy S5 6yrs ago did better. Sh¡t, even my phones from 10 years ago sent at least 1min of audio, 30sec videos, & 6pics per text. This phone is too new & nice to have these horrible qualities. RIDICULOUS! And the weather & city location stays inaccurate no matter how many times & ways I tried to adjust it. Unacceptable for a brand new phone from 2019. Best thing about this phone is the battery life. From my experience at least... It was great at 1st. After a couple weeks, every few days something new would kick in. And I periodically clean all my phones data, cache, texts, etc. Very disappointed. Especially since I bought a case & screen protectors... Replacing it with the Galaxy A71. Twice the price, but oh well. Just came out a few months ago & it's as closest I can get to a newer S series at the moment. Hopefully it doesn't let me down like this one.",,,,,
,,,,Ordered to US Versions shipped and sold by Amazon. Recieved 1 US and 1 International. Replacement sent..same thinf..INTERNATIONAL and USED! SENT ALL 3 back to Amazon. 2G of RAM. Cant play games. Barely runs. Just get a A50/51..even an A30,,,,,
,,,,The phone is strictly international couldn't even change the language,,,,,
,,,,"1st one the screen burned out while I was watching some porn so I'll be trying my luck with a second one.... 2and A10S is definitely a piece of junk also, save your time & $$$ and buy a better phone. I wanted this because it was blue. Returning new one on mon. & buying a good phone! It is a beautiful phone though........",,,,,
,,,,Phone will not keep charge.,,,,,
,,,,A great phone for the price.,,,,,
,,,,Phone is not compatible. Need to return but no shipping label in box,,,,,
,,,,"It's ok, the brightness is not as my other phone and it's hard sometimes to scan your finger. But I can't complain for the price. It does what it needs to.",,,,,
,,,,Absolute junk. I was locked out of phone on day 1 of recieving it. as soon as i pluged in the charger i could no longer access phone. It kept saying wrong pattern. Amazon would not refund until i returned it. So basicly youl have to buy a new phone then ask for refund or be out a phone for 2 weeks waiting on your new one to arive and waist half your months phone bill with no phone.. DO NOT BUY THIs OR ANY PHONE FROM AMAZON. Save time and money and go to a store . Im out a phone until they credit me back and that wont be until they receive item plus how long it takes to process plus the 5 -7 days till it shows up in bank.,,,,,
,,,,Phone was not able to receive pictures in emails. At&t staff were not able to get this feature to work.. was not looking for internet access but wanted all email functionality. Would not buy from this vendor again.,,,,,
,,,,My oldest daughter bought this and she really likes it. Great phone with no contract! Good starter phone for sure!,,,,,
,,,,Piece of junk with scamming apps from Mexico pre installed. Worst phone I have ever owned.,,,,,
,,,,"Had to buy a replacement phn., immediately. Not only was this phn. A great price, it was shipped to me in 1 day ! The galaxy products i have used, are excellent! This one has a great, large screen, beautiful pis, i love it !!",,,,,
,,,,I could not use this so-called phone at all. There was an OS update and after it was installed I was supposed to re-enter my password but it didn't let me do that. After typing a few letters of the password it shut down! I tried to type the password many times with the same nasty result. So I have no choice except to return this crap of a phone to Amazon for complete refund.,,,,,
,,,,"In the short space of time that I have had this item it has given nunerous issues to include, the charging port having issues, the sound going in and out and now there's no sound at all other than the ringtone. Good price, bad product.",,,,,
,,,,As expected. A bit slow once you apps are installed.,,,,,
,,,,Berry good item thanks I like it,,,,,
,,,,Love it,,,,,
,,,,"I would have liked to know that you couldn't use just any phone service with the phone since most services only carry certain styles or numbers. I have to go thru the phone service itself, and it will cost me more for that type if phone.",,,,,
,,,,"I have had nothing but problems with this phone since I got it. LCD, fingerprint scanner, can’t hear when someone is calling.",,,,,
,,,,I didnt onow the A10s was different from my A 10 will need a new case now but its a good phone,,,,,

,,,,I bought this phone for my sons 11th birthday! Great phone!! He loves it! Very very nice!! Price is great!!,,,,,
,,,,I am very disappointed with this phone. It doesn’t work with a Simcard inside it. I can’t get on the internet when the mobile data is on. I accidentally dropped I would have returned it already.,,,,,
,,,,Love Samsung but this phone is perfect for what I need it for.,,,,,
,,,,El precio fue muy bueno y llego a tiempo y en buenas condiciones.,,,,,
,,,,"Me gustó mucho, la entrega muy buena .. amo Amazon 😍😍😘",,,,,
,,,,Very nice phone for the price,,,,,
,,,,"At the price point I wasnt expecting it opetate as an high end phone would. Its slow to make and receive calls. When an incoming call comes in it takes a while for the call to come up or even when your trying to make one. If you can overlook this, then I recommend this phone.",,,,,
,,,,Buen cel. Muy Buena compra.,,,,,
,,,,Not brand new but in good condition.,,,,,
,,,,Fue un regalo aún no llega a Venezuela,,,,,
,,,,Price and quality was very good.,,,,,
,,,,My samsung 5 had more options and i dont like the fact that i have to push the side button to turn it on...wish i disnt change phone....,,,,,
,,,,Excellent product love it,,,,,
,,,,Super slow and the camera stopped working after 3 days. Won't even open camera app,,,,,
,,,,My phone arrived early and was brand new. Be careful not to loose the little device that was packaged in the box. You need it in order to open the phone. This phone has a lot of good features and the pricing was just right.,,,,,
,,,,"I was looking for new cell phones for both my wife and myself. I purchased this A10s because it was a unlocked phone. Right from the beginning I have been very pleased with it. It has a great screen, dynamic colors and great sound quality. This is the one I bought for my wife and she loves it.",,,,,
,,,,Love this mobile,,,,,
,,,,Exactly what I ordered super excited... love the phone,,,,,
,,,,"Mine looks used, not brand new. So obvious, lots of finger prints already both front and back.",,,,,

,,,,Wonderful,,,,,
,,,,I purchased this phone for my dad. He loves it! Its a very nice looking phone and it works great. We live in CA and we have T-mobile.,,,,,

,,,,"very cheap, but nice!",,,,,
,,,,Good quality and very good price,,,,,
,,,,"Nice product , you can by the item.",,,,,
,,,,In love with the phone this phone is definitely the best and reasonable price,,,,,
,,,,"The phone itself seemed great but theres no sim card so, I thought an easy way to fix that would be to put my old sim card in it; however, it did not work. You'll need to buy a sim card for it that works. It states on the description ""unlocked"" however the sticker says otherwise.also came with a generic charger cable.",,,,,
,,,,"I liked the overall design of the phone the size and how it foods in the hand. The speaker on the phone is loud that's a good thing and out did not come with all kindsof bloat ware, but I'm not to much on the fingerprint or face scanner and also the image for video playback is poor quality compared to my prepaid lg k8. That's why I give it a 4 star. Other wise a really good phone.",,,,,
,,,,Love it,,,,,
,,,,Got this phone for my mother. started to use it and this phone is really slow. This phone sucks.,,,,,
,,,,Love that it has a finger print reader and big screen the only problem is that it's super slow,,,,,
,,,,"I havnt tried the face recognition the phone is decentyou get what you pay for. Personally mine has a few glitches and im no tech so i deal with it. Also i got this bc it said it was compatible with page plus and it was not so i jad to change to att prepaid and ive already had an issue paying my first bill The phone looks nice and i love red but my j3 gave me less problems. Oh and when i got it everything was in spanish, simple fix and it was easy to transfer ev4 everything from my old phone.",,,,,
,,,,"Product is from Latin Ameica Samsung. Can't register your new product on Samsung.com, nor will Samsung U.S.A. honor warranty on this phone. :(",,,,,
,,,,This phone does work for US carrier just have to make sure your service provide works with the phone first.,,,,,
,,,,"It's got some flaws, not the best face rec or fingerprint scanner, however for the price, it's a great deal and every other task I've asked of the device has been completed flawlessly. I was worried that on 2g or RAM would be noticable as many of the newer phones come with3 or 4 now, but I have been unable to tell a difference or noticed any slowing in device performance. I actually purchased a 2nd one and gave it to my 64 yr old mom, it's her 1st Android device, and so far so good.",,,,,
,,,,This phone didn't work well with my phone service! Have to get my daughter a different phone now.,,,,,
,,,,Nice phone,,,,,
,,,,Love the phone!,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, I was so excited a out this phone, until, I found out, that it is in Spanish. HELLO!!!! I do not speak Spanish. I speak English, ONLY!!!!! SO, there goes keeping that phone. WHAT A WASTE. You could have saved everyone a lot of time by just asking if they spoke Spanish or Englush.",,,,,
,,,,Buen teléfono para uso básico,,,,,
,,,,Para mi uso personal,,,,,
,,,,Still a little to expensive,,,,,
,,,,"I ordered 2 phones, neither could work with Xfinity Mobile. I returned, you only refunded for one phone. HOWEVER, my 2 phone's were returned by me in one package. Please advise.... Luise George",,,,,

,,,,Nice phone but Verizon was not able to activate it.,,,,,
,,,,My boyfriend is satisfied with it.,,,,,
,,,,"I have purchased 3 different phones for my mother in law, each of them have met a fate of destruction in a fairly short time period. This phone has lasted so far, and is still in good shape. The phone is keeping good charge, and can survive having over 20 tabs open at one time, which is saying something. I would definitely recommend this purchase.",,,,,
,,,,Very new 2 days satisfied so far,,,,,
,,,,Todo bien,,,,,
,,,,Unlocked phone thats not compatable with my service . Not a very good deal for the price.,,,,,
,,,,"Screen sensibility is too bad, have to touch it several times and press it hard.",,,,,
,,,,Junk. Waste of money. Super slow. Garbage camera. Do not buy.,,,,,
,,,,good phone!!,,,,,
,,,,Personal Usage Phone and it is great for the time being!,,,,,
,,,,The cellphone overall is a very nice cellphone but it is NOT compatible with American cellphone companies. Can make calls and text. That’s it! Can use any other features. False description by third party seller. Amazon needs to remove product for being sold in America if they don’t inform the seller to change description being completely honest about the product.,,,,,
,,,,"Rápido en funcionamiento, memoria sificiente, fotos claras y nítidas. Me parece un excelente equipo. Lo necesario para mi gusto en un telefono de gama alta, ya que paso de un S8 edge y se nota la mejora. Es prácitamente lo mismo de un S21 pero a mejor precio.",,,,,
,,,,"Ok phone, but I was looking for a bigger screen, This one is not 6.2 as advertised, its smaller. Just recieved so not sure of battery life yet.",,,,,
,,,,"It's a true dual sim phone, in that it has slots for 2 sims AND a dedicated mem-card, exactly what my dad wanted for an upgrade from his old dual sim phone. I saw a lot of reviews here that they can't understand the language, the 1st time i started the phone the 1st option is to select a language, which is defaulted on Spanish. (it's rather small and can be missed if you rush through the 1st time setup). i got no complains here, my dad is old he wasn't looking for a fast phone or anything, just to upgrade from his old phone. i have to say, price wise this is a pretty good.",,,,,
,,,,"Honestly the product is great.. ive only had it 3 days, but i can already tell this was a great budget investment, dont snooze, also for the price... sheesh wyd? Get1 an the battery is real good",,,,,
,,,,Good,,,,,

,,,,good,,,,,
,,,,It is a really nice phone....love it,,,,,
,,,,Lo recomiendo,,,,,
,,,,Ok phone for by grand daughter,,,,,
,,,,This product is an absolutely no use to me since it cannot work with a Verizon plan. I am thoroughly disgusted and disappointed with this product that I can now not return because I miss the window of January 31. I have tried many different ways to get it to work and it was only when I went to the Verizon store that they informed me that it is not compatible with Verizon wireless service. So I have $130 phone that I can now use as a paper weight!,,,,,
,,,,Volume not very high. Pics not true to form. Light weight and overall functional.,,,,,
,,,,This phone works very well. It was for my nephew and his enjoying it.,,,,,
,,,,Sold as a Boost phone with no sim card.,,,,,
,,,,"Esta bien pero el teléfono vino sin audífonos y pregunte antes de comprarlos y me dijeron que si, y el plug del cargador es para Europa .",,,,,
,,,,"LLEGO UN DIA DESPUES PERO EL EQUIPO BUENO NUEVO CON TODOS ACCESORIOS (CARGADOR,CABLE,AUDIFONOS) LIBERADO",,,,,
,,,,So far the phone is working. The finger print is working well and the battery life is good. However I would advise you not to purchase from Cell Universal. I purchased a new phone for my mom. First thing I notice was a dark fog on the bottom of the screen. This damage I'm sure will get worst. I'm very disappointed!!! Don't buy!!,,,,,
,,,,Easy to use,,,,,
,,,,"Excelente producto, muy buen equipo",,,,,
,,,,Very good deal phone like new,,,,,
,,,,"I got the phone but can't understand it, it's all Spanish .",,,,,
,,,,Tous vas bien,,,,,
,,,,Wish it would connect to 5g wi-fi and took clearer pics.,,,,,
,,,,The phone is good,,,,,
,,,,This phone use for India only I need this use phone from USA this is not my mistake,,,,,
,,,,Good phone. Face recognition is not recognize my face. Other then that its a pretty good phone so far.,,,,,
,,,,Function perfectly well,,,,,
,,,,Counterfeit,,,,,
,,,,"Yes love the phone give me another phone that page plus compatible, the same phone if possible ship to me by the nov. 26 and we are even??",,,,,
,,,,It was n Spanish,,,,,
,,,,Good phone. Battery lasts over 2 days. Easy to use and it has the perfect screen size.,,,,,
,,,,I didn’t like when I put it on my phone and I saw a crack on the glass,,,,,
,,,,Terrible phone. Definitely not worth the money. Slow. Touch screen does not respond well to touch. Slow charge. Wish I could return it.,,,,,
,,,,Couldn't activate new phone. It came with no Paperwork to return it. So I Smashed it on the floor. Waste of $150.00,,,,,
,,,,"Phone Samsung Galaxy A10s,,,,,,,, very dissatified with product.....",,,,,
,,,,The phone is overall good. The price was definitely decent. It is just unfortunate that the camera is so subpar.,,,,,
,,,,Great phone at a good price.,,,,,
,,,,"Not sure yet if I will keep it. A little slow, the battery drains fast, and one of my favorite apps keeps bugging on it. I had difficulty with facetime calls, the person said the sound was always cutting. Will try again.",,,,,
,,,,"I bought this phone for my grandma. It works great in Ukraine. Phone is unlocked and works with the local providers without issues. Very loud, good camera and screen.",,,,,
,,,,Pretty sure this phone was brand new in a sealed box. I'm still learning how to use it but that's on me. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again.,,,,,
,,,,"Buena compra, tuvo un costo de $2500",,,,,
,,,,Love this phone. It is really nice. May get another for a girl.,,,,,
,,,,"Very happy with this phone, no negatives to mention. It does everything i need and it is a great price.",,,,,
,,,,"Nice phone, but unlocked and no carrier listed doesn't mean it will work with all carriers.",,,,,
,,,,The product is great it goes over it's price range.,,,,,
,,,,Phone was listed as new and I should have known after opening the undamaged shipping box and seeing a very damaged box withing that there would be problems. The phone was bent and dented on the back. Its so far bent that the screen is seperating and the adhesive is barely keeping the screen conected to the phone.,,,,,
,,,,Good customer review,,,,,
,,,,"I don't really write reviews. This is my first long review. I spent countless hours trying to find a budget Friendly Quality phone. The camera quality is pretty great in (good lighting). I like that it has portrait mode. This phone is not small, it is just Slim but I have a phone case & screen protector. The screen is big and pretty. Ive had this phone about 2-3 months & hace dropped possibly over a handful of times and no cracks. Sound quality is okay, not the Loudest. The battery is good, it can last all day Maybe two depending on phone usage. Im on my phone frequently and last me all day if full charge. It can also take a while to charge. If you live in the U.S. you may have to call your phone carrier customer line or in store to activate your IMEI to their Network in order to get phone service. I wasted about 2 days trying to do it myself 🤦🏽‍♀️ when i couldve just called customer Service and got it activated in less than 5-10 minutes. Also this phone is compatible with MOST GSM carriers NOT all, (Ex. Metro PCS, T-Mobile). It is not compatible with CDMA carriers (Ex. Verizon, Sprint). It tells us in the description box. Most importantly review the company reviews you plan to purchase the phone from so you can have an idea of what youre getting yourself into. All in all I am highly satisfied with my phone.",,,,,
,,,,Nice,,,,,
,,,,Muy Buen Producto entrega Rápida,,,,,
,,,,I was sold a faulty phone. It doesnt connect to the wifi. It appeared after the 30 days so i cant return it. Dont waste your money.,,,,,
,,,,Everything my son expected and more PS. He is only 12+,,,,,
,,,,Good for the price. People have asked if I paid it $1000+ as it looks like a pricey phone. Works well It's about a month I have it. Battery is decent.,,,,,
,,,,"Bought this for my friend, she loves it. It's like a downgrade s10",,,,,
,,,,It was a gift to my brother and he loves it he love the color the way his pictures look after taking them it’s a good phone,,,,,
,,,,Don't buy this phone. Its not what it seems to be.,,,,,
,,,,The phone is in Spanish and i cant change the setting because its on some kind of screen \ phone finger lock . a lady is talking and a cant touch anything to change the setting on the phone at all,,,,,
,,,,"The phone works for basic calls and text but there is no mobile data which means no internet unless you are on wi-fi. It also means no MMS messages so no sending or receiving pictures. We've tried ATT and T Mobile. I bought two of these last year for my husband and daughter and they were/are fine. So I ordered one for Christmas for my mom (hit reorder on the one I bought for my husband). It took my mom a while to realize that it didn't give her MMS messages. So I ate the $150 bucks because it was too late to return. Hit reorder on the phone for my daughter, got the international phone again. This time I'm returning right away.",,,,,
,,,,Thank you,,,,,
,,,,"Excelente celular, ligero .",,,,,
,,,,If you're just wanting to have a good dependable phone that does most possible functions a person could need and you don't have to refinance your home to buy it or get tied to a contract until your grandchildren are old and gray. This phone is perfect,,,,,
,,,,El mejor precio. El celular llegó en su empaque completo y en perfecto estado.,,,,,
,,,,"Got this phone to replace the Motorola G4 I'd been using for a couple of years. After only a couple months, this phone is already slower than my old Motorola. Fingerprint scanner is janky and overall it's just slow. Battery life is normal so far. Should've stuck with Motorola.",,,,,
,,,,This is one of Samsung's budget phones it's okay it's not particularly big but it's not small either the red color shines a little bit dull probably because of the plastic but it doesn't have a premium look to it if you're looking for something cheap with a premium look this isn't it as far as functionality goes fingerprint reader everything that it has works okay nothing to get excited about this is a perfect budget phone for a family member or maybe a child that needs something good they would definitely be happy with this. only problem I do have is that when I got the phone it was not sealed in plastic,,,,,
,,,,"Todo funciona correctamente, llego en el tiempo establecido, sin retrasos. Muy buen teléfono.",,,,,
,,,,"Me a gustado mucho hasta ahora a cumplido mis espectativas, gracias",,,,,
,,,,"The phone arrived packed securely in a box. I purchsed this phone as a gift for my mothet in law and she loves it. However, after 3 days the phone start having issues. The speaker on the phone went out and she can only talk and hear on the phone when speaker phone is on.",,,,,
,,,,This phone did not work with AT&T as advertised,,,,,
,,,,I bought this item from this seller and right when I got it the keyboard didn't work then after a month the screen went blank and the phone stopped working,,,,,
,,,,Very nice packaging freat phone excellent condition,,,,,
,,,,Can't used not in english you could of said that before you sold it,,,,,
,,,,"I bought the phone in 2020, it works great for me. I'd recommend it. Inexpensive but a good phone.",,,,,
,,,,Muy buen producto,,,,,
,,,,Phone is having slag and it strucks b/w operations. Not happy with purchase can't return as already crossed retun date.,,,,,
,,,,I use this for my kids to talk to grandparents. Not much used but serves the purpose.,,,,,
,,,,I like the phone camera is perfect WhatsApp calls and videos are perfect but regular calls it’s not good at all it makes so much noise I can kip not hear a word the person is saying and also the person cannot hear me is a new phone I just bought it. How can the problem be fixed?,,,,,
,,,,Beautiful,,,,,
,,,,purchased this phone twice the first phone one we got the call quality was horrible it would scramble and drop calls constantly. When trying to call out it would take a minute or two literally before it would ring to the person you were calling. It hardly ever had service bars on it which made it even harder to communicate with someone when it finally dialed out. we thought that phone was just defective so we sent that phone back and ordered another one. Got that one in and it did the same exact thing. So we sent that one back too and are still waiting on our refund.Its a beautiful phone but not all things that are pretty are worth a crap. Its a really crappy phone. Not worth the money or the headache.,,,,,
,,,,My phone just stopped working keeps glitching and no one can hear me it started to curve,,,,,
,,,,Cant get it out of Spanish touch screen will not work,,,,,
,,,,"The phone overall seems fine, but the wiffi gets disconected, it shows connected with no internet.... Crazy!!! Have gone over all the configurations and the problem persists. I am abroad and will be back in the US with this broken pone in October, I don't know if I will be able to return it then....",,,,,
,,,,Exelente,,,,,
,,,,"Todo muy bien, solo que no venía con audífonos",,,,,
,,,,"First of all as a Canadian , this phone is not for you. While texting, it doesn't have a feature of auto spell check. Also you cannot receive the images on text messages. This is not even $50.00 worth phone. There are so many generic smartphones better than this one.",,,,,
,,,,"Purchase this cellphone for my nephew for Christmas. It will now no longer charge and we have tried multiple new charging cords and docks with it, with no change. We are now out the money and have to purchase him a new phone. Do not recommend this phone at all.",,,,,
,,,,It is a nice phone with dual sim,,,,,
,,,,It seems fragile but nothing a case can’t help,,,,,
,,,,Muy bueno lo recomiendo,,,,,
,,,,"I like this phone really nice and works well. The camera isn't that good the front camera is a bit blurry especially in low-light, the back camera is a lot better.",,,,,
,,,,Great phone. I've had it for over 3 months and I think it's great. It's more sleek than I expected so I'm happy with the purchase.,,,,,
,,,,"Ok so I had this phone for about a year now. And my girl absolutely loves it. She even said she would buy the same phone again, Although, I may upgrade it to the next gen.",,,,,
,,,,Good money value,,,,,
,,,,"Good quality, happy with the phone. Only bad thing is the shipping took a loooooong time.",,,,,
,,,,I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. Mine is perfect. When you load the phone for the first time it gives you the option to change from spanish to english. I loved how it could communicate with my own phone after I downloaded an app on my old phone to transfer everything from my old phone to the new one. I had even written down the apps I had figuring I would have to download them all again but I didn't have to yay!!! Someone mentioned they didn't get a manual. I did but I don't need a manual. If you have had an android before you should be able to operate this without a manual. I was pleasantly surprised to get a hands free device with my new phone and my sim card went in the same way as my other phone so I had no issues there. All and all a great phone for the price. I also bought a hard case for it so I won't break the screen on this one. Hopefully people will see my review. I really like this phone.,,,,,
,,,,Works really great period if you need basic fun usage that would be the one. Very affordable and great quality,,,,,
,,,,"This is by far the worst phone ever!! Screen sensitivity is extremely slow, have to tap icons several times! Phone process everything slow, if on the phone using an app, when a call comes in a black screen shows up - it literally takes a good minute to see the number calling. There are so many issues with this phone I can begin to list. Tried to return, but there was a significant restocking fee. Don't buy whatever you do!!",,,,,
,,,,Llego en el tiempo estipulado Muy buen producto,,,,,
,,,,Phone Keeps dropping calls while talking.,,,,,
,,,,It’s a a great phone,,,,,
,,,,I love the look and features of this phone especially that it's affordable also.,,,,,
,,,,They don’t say that it’s not recognizable in USA. Sent it back after trying with my carrier to no avail.,,,,,
,,,,Was satisfied with features and storage of device compared to last owned device,,,,,
,,,,"Se devolvió, pues a pesar de llegar con rotura en el empaque, no llegaba al equipo por lo lo cargue, y le puse su conectividad, sin embargo no podía oír cuando me realizaban las llamadas, si era escuchada pero yo no escuchaba, lo cual fue el motivo de la devolución",,,,,
,,,,"It wasn't new - like i expected, and no charger. The cell phone box was opened, and retaped too. I ordered this phone that is simple to use for my elderly mother!",,,,,
,,,,"Item was as espectro, am happy",,,,,
,,,,"I have never had so many problems with a smart phone. It is slow as molasses with everyday tasks and is just a nuisance to set up and use. This phone cannot handle something as basic as MMS - it cannot send or receive group texts. I've never heard of anything like that! None of the fixes I can find online remedy the problem. Did a factory reset and lost all my settings and contacts, MMS issue still not corrected. This is my first Samsung smart phone and undoubtedly my very last. Just an absolute nightmare ownership experience and because I tried everything I could to salvage this piece of garbage I missed the return deadline. Seriously, do yourself a favor and avoid this phone at all costs. Samsung is a garbage brand that makes garbage products.",,,,,
,,,,It's okay so far. I like it for the most part. I just received it a few days ago and my biggest complaint so far is the screen not being as responsive as most other Samsung phones. Sometimes I have to keep tapping the screen to open a app or click a link. Hopefully that will be over shadowed by everything else. Time will tell!! Will give update in abt another week.,,,,,
,,,,Do not buy!!! I can't even get 4g internet on here it's either 3g or h+ idk what that even means!,,,,,
,,,,"I had purchased this phone for my brother as a Christmas gift and the phone came locked, after contacting the company as to why it was locked, they really did not have a good answer to give me. And it make no sense contacting samsung, cause there customer was not good either.",,,,,
,,,,This phone is not compatible to any wireless service in the United States. I really would like a refund,,,,,
,,,,Yes,,,,,
,,,,Scam. Broken. Doesn’t charge or turn on,,,,,
,,,,I needed an upgrade and this is user friendly and love the color.,,,,,
,,,,How do i get an exhange i am already having problems and have had since sunday. Already freezing up. Not to happy,,,,,
,,,,It’s for use for India only!! That’s not on the description at all. Now I have no Christmas gift to give. Thanks!,,,,,

,,,,"la calidad, la vida de la batería.",,,,,
,,,,"On screen Does not rotate 360° It is very slippery to hold. Comes with Samsung Internet browser, which I never used. Transferred all my iPhone photos and music. But dropped transfer of many Facebook contacts.",,,,,
,,,,"This phone is much nicer than I expected, and better than the more expensive phones I looked at like the Galaxy S10. It has a good sized screen, but it's very thin and light. Battery life is outstanding- still 70% after a full day of use. The dual SIM is great for international use, and the phone was fully unlocked so my Google Fi sim card worked immediately. There was no carrier software cluttering up the memory. The initial language was Spanish but I was able to set up the phone by choosing English language on the first screen. I used Samsung Smart Switch to move my apps and data from my old phone, so I was fully up and running in just a couple of hours. Highly recommend!",,,,,
,,,,Reach in time,,,,,
,,,,Muy buen producto,,,,,
,,,,Refund Me! I bought this phone 3 months ago and I regret this purchase. This phone has a pathetic camera. The voice calls sound weak and moblie data is nonexistent and it doesn't switch to wifi when it comes to a hotspot. The phone takes hours to charge and the battery has multiple issues. This phone is the worst that I've ever bought and I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!,,,,,
,,,,"The phone hasn't been used yet because I bought it as a gift, until the owner received use it and confirmed how smart and beautiful it is then my review will sound great. But with the way the phone was, it's an extremely elegant and smart enough.",,,,,
,,,,parfait je suis tres content,,,,,
,,,,My personal phone and not real impressed kinda hard to figure out and no book for instruct on how,,,,,
,,,,"The phone's looks and feels great, BUT weird issues. I am giving a 3 star to the seller mainly for sending faulty products inside the box. I just received the phone few hours ago, so unable to give feed back based on the internal workability of the electronic product itself; I will update my review if needed. Here are the things that is wrong with the product I was sent (pictures included): 1. There is somesort of weird piece of plastic sticking out from the edge of the phone screen. I tried to take it out (even with a tweezer) but it just wont come out. I can may be try to file the plastic but it has a high chance of getting the screen scratched. 2. WTH is wrong with the ear buds? OMG! The right side is only few inches long and the left one is regular length. How the heck am I supposed to use them. To use them I would have to lower down my neck to a 0° angle towards my right shoulder. Definitely not useable! 3. Are those ear buds for giants? They don't even fit and it hurts and are extremely uncomfortable because of the odd shape and size. 4. The SD card slot is working so far, but it is slanted!/bent!! If you are a content creator or capture your work on the phone, so you will be taking it out very often, then good luck cause it will break!",,,,,
,,,,"I bought this as a replacement phone, making sure to check the description and questions to see it worked with AT&T. It does NOT. Apparently AT&T is eliminating 3G and it's system sees many older phones as 3G even if they are 4G. This is one of them. Make sure you specifically check with AT&T before you buy a phone!!!",,,,,

The phone takes good pics, can be personalized to your liking of course. The only negatives I've noticed thus far is that the phone was programmed in Espanol which I'm not fluent in at all. But I was able to work my through it and program it to English. Also I couldn't get the facial recognition to work when I first tried it but I'll reattempt again later. Also please not this phone has 3 compartments for sims card. All in all I'm pleased thus far and would likely purchase from this company again.",,,,,

,,,,Nice,,,,,
,,,,For the price this phone is hard to beat!,,,,,
,,,,"If you want a phone that is easy to use, clear sound, beautiful pictures , stylish AND tough, great battery life and is AFFORDABLE, this is the phone for you. When my Galaxy J3 finally threw in the towel, I tried some new fangled phones, off brands promising better! Faster! Greater! Bigger!! They weren't. They blacked out, quit working for no reason, sounded bad, wouldn't charge, ... so I did what I should have done in the first place... I purchased another Samsung Galaxy Phone. I upgraded my J3 (which I dropped more times than I can remember, and in water at least 30 times😳 before it finally developed a glitch🤣) to this. NOTHING beats a Samsung Galaxy phone. They're easy to use, good cameras, excellent screen area , clear, sharp, vibrant. And tough enough. I'm hard on phones. Galaxy can take it. This is the first time I've tried an international version, and with double Sim capabilities. I turned this phone on , set it on English, put in my AT&T pre paid Sim card i had used in two of the POS phones, and that was it .. no problems at all. This Galaxy phone was well worth the money, as was my Galaxy.phone before it. It has everything that I need and then some. And at an awesome price. I dont live on my phone like a lot of folks do. But I want to be able to count on it when I need to. I wasted somewhere between four and six hundred dollars on crappie POS phones(and one with a service plan I could never quite use). They promise everything and delivered nothing. I will not make that mistake again.",,,,,
,,,,I'm really happy with this purchase. So much better than financing a ridiculously priced phone for the next two years. Does everything my old $800 smartphone did and its pretty fast and reliable.,,,,,
,,,,Battery life.,,,,,
,,,,Absolutely loved this battery life is great never have any problems with the fingerprint reader or face recognition. It was in perfect condition when arrived it also came with charger and a set of earphones.,,,,,
,,,,"This phone is the worst phone ever seems like every time I ""upgrade "" the phones get worse",,,,,

,,,,Great phone just wish it had all cell phones company's,,,,,
,,,,"I like the finger print recogition and the feature that you can add multiple finger prints, so I have both my left and right index fingers set up to operate the device. The phone turns on from the side, but also if you place your finger on the reader in the rear, which is a natural way to hold the phone, it's turns on right away. I haven't set up the facial recognition so I can't comment on that. Using the Samsung APP ""Smart Switch"", all my data and APPs transferred to the new phone. I did have to log back in to the APP accounts on the new phone, which was a good safety feature, in my opinion, in case someone where to do it without your knowledge, they wouldn't have immediate access to your information/accounts. I am very happy with this purchase.",,,,,
,,,,Really like this phone wish it had came with a case I had to convert my iphone7 plus case as a temp case until I can get one but this galaxy a10s is a very good phone thanks Again guys,,,,,
,,,,Why all the bad reviews from canada? Somebody doesn't want you to buy this phone? They must think that we're not intelligent we can always send the phone back.,,,,,
,,,,Ok.,,,,,
,,,,Very good deal phone like new,,,,,
,,,,"The clock was wrong and I can’t put the alarm, the location not work properly was waste of money",,,,,
,,,,"I had already purchased this phone and was very happy with it and would have given it 4 stars (camera is just OK) but I dropped it and the glass was shattered. I clicked on the ""buy it again"" button on my order page expecting to get the same phone. I did not. It looked the same but there were important differences. The first clue that something was wrong was the adapters in the box which were not compatible with any electrical outlet I have. Next, after transferring all my data I noticed several unusual things. Any app that spoke had a british accent (which I didn't mind, but seemed odd). My weather app is set to 24 hour time and no matter how often I change it to 12 hour, it always reverts back to 24 hour. The dates on my email are listed as day/month/year so that March 20th would read 20/3/20. I then discovered an insert in the instructions informing me that the phone was from India and should be activated with a sim card issued in India. If I used a sim issued from another region the phone might not function properly. I live in Pennsylvania and that is where my sim card was issued. I called customer service, explained the situation and they sent me a new phone, assuring me that my experience was a mistake that would not happen again. My 2nd new phone came, again with the weird adapters and sure enough, a card that said the phone was an Indian phone to be activated with a sim card issued in India. That phone is also going back and I have ordered a completely different phone. Read the phone description carefully before purchasing. If it says International phone, do not order it!",,,,,
,,,,The finger recognition not so good. But love the phone..Arrived in great shape..an a bonus I received earbuds as well,,,,,
,,,,I just received the phone today and it will not charge no matter what cord/outlet I use. I tried to leave it connected to charge for the whole day but it does not show how much it has charged and will not turn on no matter what I do.,,,,,

,,,,Absolute junk. I was locked out of phone on day 1 of recieving it. as soon as i pluged in the charger i could no longer access phone. It kept saying wrong pattern. Amazon would not refund until i returned it. So basicly youl have to buy a new phone then ask for refund or be out a phone for 2 weeks waiting on your new one to arive and waist half your months phone bill with no phone.. DO NOT BUY THIs OR ANY PHONE FROM AMAZON. Save time and money and go to a store . Im out a phone until they credit me back and that wont be until they receive item plus how long it takes to process plus the 5 -7 days till it shows up in bank.,,,,,

I am going try to post some pics to show you proof.",,,,,
,,,,i am not a power user but this phone looks good works well and was relatively inexpensive. i am satisfied with the product.,,,,,
,,,,Good phone,,,,,
,,,,"Ok so I had this phone for about a year now. And my girl absolutely loves it. She even said she would buy the same phone again, Although, I may upgrade it to the next gen.",,,,,
,,,,Good phone. Battery lasts over 2 days. Easy to use and it has the perfect screen size.,,,,,
,,,,I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. Mine is perfect. When you load the phone for the first time it gives you the option to change from spanish to english. I loved how it could communicate with my own phone after I downloaded an app on my old phone to transfer everything from my old phone to the new one. I had even written down the apps I had figuring I would have to download them all again but I didn't have to yay!!! Someone mentioned they didn't get a manual. I did but I don't need a manual. If you have had an android before you should be able to operate this without a manual. I was pleasantly surprised to get a hands free device with my new phone and my sim card went in the same way as my other phone so I had no issues there. All and all a great phone for the price. I also bought a hard case for it so I won't break the screen on this one. Hopefully people will see my review. I really like this phone.,,,,,
,,,,Great phone so far. My daughter uses it for games and seems fast and reliable.,,,,,
,,,,"It is a great cheap phone but the only issue i had is that, even though it says US compatible, it does not work with Verizon net.",,,,,
,,,,"This may not show up as a verified purchase because someone else bought me this phone for me, but I feel manipulated and used for capitalistic gain for Samsung's benefit having purchased this $144 phone which does not serve its purpose. On top of that I can't even figure out who to talk to get a refund. So what am I supposed to do just buy another phone?? Well if I do I won't be from you!",,,,,
,,,,This unit allows both SIMs that I use to be in teh same phone. The memory expansion with the SD card makes the phone a good music provider.,,,,,

,,,,My work schedule,,,,,
,,,,Very good,,,,,

,,,,"Disappointed. I loved my past Samsung phones and did my research on this model. Functions are limited for a phone in this price range: shutter sound on the camera can not be turned off, subpar camera (poor focus, blurry pictures, lag), the reception is awful (drops calls when my service is solid), lag when opening and closing apps. Generally a mediocre phone. Pros: light weight, seems rugged, good battery life, charges fast, has tons of storage.",,,,,
,,,,It was a gift I made to my mother. But it Looks and feels good so far working perfect she's only had it activated for two days. Is a great phone for starters.,,,,,

,,,,"Phone works great and compatible with Metro PCS. Phone arrived brand new in sealed Samsung box with charger plug, cable and earbuds.",,,,,
,,,,This is one of Samsung's budget phones it's okay it's not particularly big but it's not small either the red color shines a little bit dull probably because of the plastic but it doesn't have a premium look to it if you're looking for something cheap with a premium look this isn't it as far as functionality goes fingerprint reader everything that it has works okay nothing to get excited about this is a perfect budget phone for a family member or maybe a child that needs something good they would definitely be happy with this. only problem I do have is that when I got the phone it was not sealed in plastic,,,,,

,,,,I love it! Can you accommodate me with another one free for advertising your product?,,,,,
,,,,I like this item samsung phone,,,,,
,,,,WORKS GOOD,,,,,
,,,,It's okay so far. I like it for the most part. I just received it a few days ago and my biggest complaint so far is the screen not being as responsive as most other Samsung phones. Sometimes I have to keep tapping the screen to open a app or click a link. Hopefully that will be over shadowed by everything else. Time will tell!! Will give update in abt another week.,,,,,
,,,,Good product,,,,,
,,,,This phone is no longer compatible with ATT as of January 19th. The seller needs to update comments on compatibility. I am returning this phone.,,,,,
,,,,I did not have it long before the microphone went out on it. I had to put it on speaker when I received or made a call. The return policy from amazon was great.,,,,,
,,,,"Good size, storage, color and easy to use.",,,,,
,,,,I really like this Samsung! It’s new and works well,,,,,
,,,,"I liked the overall design of the phone the size and how it foods in the hand. The speaker on the phone is loud that's a good thing and out did not come with all kindsof bloat ware, but I'm not to much on the fingerprint or face scanner and also the image for video playback is poor quality compared to my prepaid lg k8. That's why I give it a 4 star. Other wise a really good phone.",,,,,
,,,,Phone does not work already,,,,,
,,,,This phone has a mind of its own none of the settings stay for long go what I set them to. Freezes turns off it just sucks,,,,,
,,,,"I hate this phone. I have nothing bad to say about the seller, it arrived quickly and is what was promised. However, I find this phone absolutely maddening and have wanted to throw it or drop kick it so many times that I've lost count. The most annoying feature is it's accidental touch protection. If you set the phone down, like on a table, and you want to use it, you cannot. It will not respond to touch unless you pick it up. There is a place to turn it off in the settings, but it still does this even after you tell it not to. It is a large, heavy phone and I do not always want to hold it, I should be able to set it down and use it, but no. Accidental touch is not something I've ever even worried about with smart phones. I don't know why they felt it was a necessary feature. I used a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge for four years and switching to this phone was painful. I'm comparison, this phone is a cheap pos. I really like the Google sky map app, it won't work on this phone. After about a month of use, it's decided it doesn't work inside my house. All calls are garbled and it drops most of them. It frequently loses connection to the network when outside of the home as well. I would give it zero stars if possible. I wish I understood the difference between the s model and the a model before purchasing because I would not have bought this phone. It's become so useless after a little over a month of use that I've broken down and spent the money for an s9. I would have just bought one in the first place if I knew how cheaply made this one .was.",,,,,
,,,,Love this phone!!!,,,,,
,,,,I like this phone battery life is fantastic. its dual sim card capable.,,,,,

,,,,My phone is acting up again. What is really going on here. No one wants to take the responsibility to sharing so e light on my purchase which is not working. I upgrade every so often and that is not helping the microphone. Could someone please help me with my issue . I would be grateful.,,,,,

I can use this phone with Verizon without even calling them, I will use it when I travel overseas as well. I am buying a second phone for my dad from same seller",,,,,
,,,,Wow very good phone,,,,,
,,,,Would have been 5 stars except that the phone starts in Spanish which makes a chore to initialize using a Spanish-English dictionary. Other than that it works great and has most of the bells and whistles most ordinary users need. It even allows tethering for Tracfone which means that you can set up a mobile hotspot which ordinary tracfones do not allow. Lets my wife and kids play online games on their tablets on long trips. Fingerprint reader makes logging onto websites and apps much easier,,,,,

,,,,It was not unlocked. It didnot meet my expectations,,,,,
,,,,"This item is not described correctly. In the description it says that this is a unlocked smart phone, and on the bottom of the box it says it’s a locked smart phone. When I tried to activate it with my wireless provider they confirmed for me that indeed it was a locked smart phone and they could not activate it. I would not recommend buying this phone. Will be returning it.",,,,,
,,,,"The phone arrived packed securely in a box. I purchsed this phone as a gift for my mothet in law and she loves it. However, after 3 days the phone start having issues. The speaker on the phone went out and she can only talk and hear on the phone when speaker phone is on.",,,,,
,,,,"The audio is not good at all. People tell me they hear me as if I was speaking through a tunnel, and forget about using the speaker, it's even worse. Listening to someone speaking to me on the phone is an agony! And all the audio features are all in the correct setting.",,,,,
,,,,"This was my first time (and the 2nd didn't fair any better) buying an unlocked phone from Amazon. I loved this phone, but it wouldn't work with Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, Spectrum or Cincinnati Bell. I would WARN anyone trying to do the unlocked phone thing to be VERY careful.",,,,,
,,,,love it,,,,,
,,,,"On time, and well works.",,,,,
,,,,All the stuff that it came with,,,,,
,,,,Unable to connect to the 4G red US. Tmobile Trouble shooting,,,,,
,,,,My LG Stylo is 2 years old with a cracked screen still has better screen response then this piece of junk. Really slow operating. The camera is the only decent thing about this phone,,,,,
,,,,phone number missing on sim card and no support from samsung,,,,,
,,,,"Phone functions are good, but battery life is really bad i am lucky to get 12 hous in power save mode. Only issue is that, battery life. Expected more from a 4000 mah samsung. I bought this thinking i wouldnt have to go everywhere with a cord and my budget is the lowest. I would have priced this phone at 75.00. Battery is that bad.",,,,,
,,,,That is a great phone for my price!!!!,,,,,
,,,,"This phone is much nicer than I expected, and better than the more expensive phones I looked at like the Galaxy S10. It has a good sized screen, but it's very thin and light. Battery life is outstanding- still 70% after a full day of use. The dual SIM is great for international use, and the phone was fully unlocked so my Google Fi sim card worked immediately. There was no carrier software cluttering up the memory. The initial language was Spanish but I was able to set up the phone by choosing English language on the first screen. I used Samsung Smart Switch to move my apps and data from my old phone, so I was fully up and running in just a couple of hours. Highly recommend!",,,,,
,,,,Great phone. Long lasting battery. Camera takes really good vivid pics,,,,,
,,,,Not really well,,,,,
,,,,great phone,,,,,
,,,,Good phone worth the money. I was so excited to give this phone to my son for a gift but during these bad times someone stole it from my 9 year son at least he got to enjoy for three days so sad 😞,,,,,
,,,,Phone is cheaply made. I dropped the phone barely chufy and the screen broke this is my second phone has my first one the screen cracked as well. IPhones can survive a drop off a damn 10-story building but this Samsung phone can't even survive a two foot drop. It is a very sad and disappointing product from such a a so-called great company. Do not buy stay away from this phone,,,,,
,,,,"I got my phone 4 days ago. It was very easy to set up and change the language. So easy. The phone takes good pics. I enjoy pictures more because I enjoy memories, so camera is important to me. I downgraded from a galaxy 10 bc it shattered. But I really enjoy this phone. Great buy, and will buy one for my son for his birthday!",,,,,
,,,,Everything,,,,,
,,,,Perfect phone,,,,,
,,,,"Phone too expensive, bad optimization, even if this phone has 4 or 8 cores the operating system makes it lag all the time, even if you want to access to the calendar it lags, wow I'm still surprised how this phone got in the market, even my Samsung j7 2016 is faster than this cr*p, so if you play a game it lags, if you go to menu it lags, touchscreen is not sensitive, have to click twice or even three times to get response, I regret I bought this phone.",,,,,
,,,,Love this phone!,,,,,
,,,,"very cheap, but nice!",,,,,
,,,,Product does not work.,,,,,
,,,,I like the phone camera is perfect WhatsApp calls and videos are perfect but regular calls it’s not good at all it makes so much noise I can kip not hear a word the person is saying and also the person cannot hear me is a new phone I just bought it. How can the problem be fixed?,,,,,
,,,,No English Instructions so i refused to keep the phone.,,,,,
,,,,The companies interact do not work most important to know,,,,,
,,,,The person receiving this was very happy,,,,,
,,,,Great inexpensive Cell phone,,,,,
,,,,purchased this phone twice the first phone one we got the call quality was horrible it would scramble and drop calls constantly. When trying to call out it would take a minute or two literally before it would ring to the person you were calling. It hardly ever had service bars on it which made it even harder to communicate with someone when it finally dialed out. we thought that phone was just defective so we sent that phone back and ordered another one. Got that one in and it did the same exact thing. So we sent that one back too and are still waiting on our refund.Its a beautiful phone but not all things that are pretty are worth a crap. Its a really crappy phone. Not worth the money or the headache.,,,,,
,,,,"1st one the screen burned out while I was watching some porn so I'll be trying my luck with a second one.... 2and A10S is definitely a piece of junk also, save your time & $$$ and buy a better phone.

,,,,"It freezes too much. Can't send more than 2-3 pics per text. Can't send video or audio longer than 10 seconds. Sends my screenshots & videos very blurry... My J3 Prime (4yr old phone) I replaced with this phone was capable of more. My Galaxy S5 6yrs ago did better. Sh¡t, even my phones from 10 years ago sent at least 1min of audio, 30sec videos, & 6pics per text. This phone is too new & nice to have these horrible qualities. RIDICULOUS! And the weather & city location stays inaccurate no matter how many times & ways I tried to adjust it. Unacceptable for a brand new phone from 2019. Best thing about this phone is the battery life. From my experience at least... It was great at 1st. After a couple weeks, every few days something new would kick in. And I periodically clean all my phones data, cache, texts, etc. Very disappointed. Especially since I bought a case & screen protectors... Replacing it with the Galaxy A71. Twice the price, but oh well. Just came out a few months ago & it's as closest I can get to a newer S series at the moment. Hopefully it doesn't let me down like this one.",,,,,

,,,,Phone was listed as new and I should have known after opening the undamaged shipping box and seeing a very damaged box withing that there would be problems. The phone was bent and dented on the back. Its so far bent that the screen is seperating and the adhesive is barely keeping the screen conected to the phone.,,,,,

Then the return process for the replacement was more difficult then I'd like. I'm currently waiting for a ups driver to pick up my phone when I could have just returned it with the other one to Kohl's. Absolutely no kohls drop off as an option and even though amazon gives you a time window for the ups man to arrive ups does not give out time windows whatsoever. Huge discrepancy there. As a consumer I am not happy with amazon nor am I happy with UPS. This isn't my first issue with Amazon and personally I'm beginning to feel that Amazon sucks and I'm about to choose to live without that convenience since it's no longer super convenient. They have absolutely no discourse as to when these issues arrive, no sympathies for their mistakes no sorry for the inconveniences here a percentage or a coupon, a month free for your loyalty to make up for our booboo nothing just a big fat eff you.

,,,,"I have never had so many problems with a smart phone. It is slow as molasses with everyday tasks and is just a nuisance to set up and use. This phone cannot handle something as basic as MMS - it cannot send or receive group texts. I've never heard of anything like that! None of the fixes I can find online remedy the problem. Did a factory reset and lost all my settings and contacts, MMS issue still not corrected. This is my first Samsung smart phone and undoubtedly my very last. Just an absolute nightmare ownership experience and because I tried everything I could to salvage this piece of garbage I missed the return deadline. Seriously, do yourself a favor and avoid this phone at all costs. Samsung is a garbage brand that makes garbage products.",,,,,

My phone already game with someone else's information TIMTHEGAMER204@GMAIL.COM. I would like some of my money back. Why would I pay full price for something that is used and not new? I purchase pre owned items often but not for the same price as a new item. That is absurd. As a seller you should be honest. You already know this phone was pre owned. List that so as a consumer I can make my proper decision. You should make this right.,,,,,

,,,,"Absolutely the most aggravating pile of trash i have ever used. It's comparable to a defective Blu phone. I honestly didn't even finish updates before i knew i hated it. I will never buy a samsung again. Guaranteed. The price cannot be justified just because of the storage. I prefer using my broken ran over 50$ LG. The swyping is unforgivable, doesn't auto space in Google search, literally swypes words that words that doesn't exist in three English language, and oh yeah i checked and triple checked language settings spell checking. Now considering this is a phone.... i should be able to call and gave a conversation, that would be nice. However the ""sim card data has changed, device will reset automatically"" happens every 10 seconds to 2 minutes killing my service. Now. Even more embarrassing is the sound quality. Im talking my kyocera from 1999 DUMPS on this thing, so quiet sounds like only half the speakers work, they sound super chincy. Just cheap crap. On to Samsung customer service. Not good. Ima just leave it at that. Id rather blindfold myself and play in heavy high speed traffic than use this phone.

,,,,Great phone just what I needed,,,,,
,,,,Love that it has a finger print reader and big screen the only problem is that it's super slow,,,,,
,,,,"I bought this as a replacement phone, making sure to check the description and questions to see it worked with AT&T. It does NOT. Apparently AT&T is eliminating 3G and it's system sees many older phones as 3G even if they are 4G. This is one of them. Make sure you specifically check with AT&T before you buy a phone!!!",,,,,
,,,,I purchased this phone as a birthday gift for my father. He's been using it for a few months now and he loves it. It's fairly simple to use and it was actually fun teaching him the new technology in them like the fingerprint reader and facial recognition. It was brand new in the box and the unlocked GSM meant we could put it on any service we wanted to.,,,,,
,,,,"I would like a Verizon phone with its own SIM card, the one I received is not Verizon compatible and has no SIM card, so I am returning this Samsung A10s for another Verizon phone of the same value",,,,,
,,,,Receive product and it seems like the product was opened. Found the phone on and without the protecting plastic cover.,,,,,
,,,,"I purchased this phone to take out of country 4 months ago, when I finally got to my destination I can't even use it because the screen is locked up and there's no instruction on a password...even Google search on hard re-set won't work !!! I'm extremely disappointed since this phone is completely unusable I just wasted money. You would think that the seller would include the password so that it would be usable as a phone instead of a doorstop !",,,,,
,,,,Perfect for my intended use,,,,,
,,,,Works great,,,,,
,,,,Very nice phone,,,,,
,,,,Battery life is good,,,,,
,,,,"The phone worked ok for about 2 days and then it started having a mind of its own. I started talking on its own, changing apps to other apps when one was open. This phone goes crazy blinking off and on and the list goes on!!!!",,,,,
,,,,I haven't used the face recognition or the fingerprint reader but the battery life is excellent,,,,,
,,,,Wasn’t compatible my company,,,,,
,,,,arrived as expected,,,,,
,,,,excellent,,,,,
,,,,I lake,,,,,
,,,,Perfect,,,,,
,,,,Arrived on time and is a good quality phone!!,,,,,
,,,,Phone was not able to receive pictures in emails. At&t staff were not able to get this feature to work.. was not looking for internet access but wanted all email functionality. Would not buy from this vendor again.,,,,,
,,,,That's is .... SAMSUNG !!!,,,,,
,,,,When i got this phone it was what i would never expect it works great battery charges fast and runs down very slowy and i would reccomend you to buy it,,,,,
,,,,"I like that this phone was truly unlocked and didn't have a problem activating it on my carrier. The only issue is that when I try to video call on WhatsApp , my phone powers off.",,,,,
,,,,Ear speaker stopped working after a less than a month. If i want to listen to a call it has to be on speaker phone.,,,,,
,,,,I am very disappointed with this phone. It doesn’t work with a Simcard inside it. I can’t get on the internet when the mobile data is on. I accidentally dropped I would have returned it already.,,,,,

,,,,Says its unlocked but didnt say it wasnt for verison tower until i got the box and the sd card wasnt in there,,,,,

,,,,The SD port was torn I couldn't log back into the phone fingerprint didn't work and the phone was slow only good thing was the camera,,,,,
,,,,"Great product, it is a little slow and glitchy here and there. But still works, nice and sleek, gets the job done. :)",,,,,
,,,,Berry good item thanks I like it,,,,,
,,,,"At the price point I wasnt expecting it opetate as an high end phone would. Its slow to make and receive calls. When an incoming call comes in it takes a while for the call to come up or even when your trying to make one. If you can overlook this, then I recommend this phone.",,,,,
,,,,How can you sell an unlocked phone and then It doesn't work with Verizon or AT&T? What is that? Those are the two most important service providers! Not to mention now I have return it and I've waisted so much time going to a Verizon retailer store too.,,,,,
,,,,"Si me agrado,me pareció fantástico y bueno",,,,,
,,,,It DOESN'T WORK WITH A VERIZON SIM CARD I wish it I read the small print,,,,,

,,,,EXCELENTE,,,,,
,,,,"The phone itself was great, but it was only capable of 3G. It would not work for my purpose.",,,,,
,,,,"I haven't tried theface recognition yet, but everything else works fine. I received the memory card and its working well so far",,,,,
,,,,Scam. Broken. Doesn’t charge or turn on,,,,,
,,,,Very good phone my mum love it,,,,,

,,,,Love the phone!,,,,,
,,,,It stopped working after a month. Buying refurbished is risky.,,,,,
,,,,Very disapponted purchased only 4 months ago and suddenly wont make calls or texts was working fine loved the phone went to bed and it just stopped very dissapointed,,,,,
,,,,I only use this phone to check work email because I don’t want company app on my iPhone 12. This Samsung phone is about 30 seconds slower than my iPhone 12. Otherwise it’s ok.,,,,,
,,,,Pretty sure this phone was brand new in a sealed box. I'm still learning how to use it but that's on me. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again.,,,,,
,,,,"Absolutely beautiful phone, brand new. Fingerprint reader is amazing and battery life is unreal 3 days plus.",,,,,
,,,,Do not buy!!! I can't even get 4g internet on here it's either 3g or h+ idk what that even means!,,,,,
,,,,"Purxhased the Galaxy A10S, Caribbean. The keyboard vibrate (haptic feedback) feature is completely missing from the menus. You can get sound when keypress but you cannot make it vibrate. Was online with both US and Caribbean supporrtand kept getting runaround. Too late to return it. So US buyers beware.",,,,,
,,,,"Honestly the product is great.. ive only had it 3 days, but i can already tell this was a great budget investment, dont snooze, also for the price... sheesh wyd? Get1 an the battery is real good",,,,,
,,,,Really good phone works with MetroPCS,,,,,
,,,,I can't really review the item as the box was empty when I received it. The Amazon box was perfectly fine but upon opening that box I noticed the box that was supposed to contain the phone was awfully light and the seal was broken. I opened it and the oy thing in the box was the block that plugs into the wall to charge it.,,,,,
,,,,Love Samsung but this phone is perfect for what I need it for.,,,,,
,,,,Instructions came in Spanish but overall satisfied with the phone.,,,,,
,,,,"I bought this for my mum and didn’t read reviews first, I wish I had. Like everyone says it arrives with the default language to Spanish. It is not “unlocked” and does not work with AT&T.",,,,,

,,,,"It is a great item, i will recommend.",,,,,
,,,,Está muy bueno,,,,,
,,,,"I love the product and the time in which I received it, it's alsome!",,,,,
,,,,The phone was as advertised for a good price. The only issue was the packaging was in Spanish so I had to go on line to get the set up instructions and other information you usually need with a new phone. All elese was great.,,,,,
,,,,The phone is in Spanish and i cant change the setting because its on some kind of screen \ phone finger lock . a lady is talking and a cant touch anything to change the setting on the phone at all,,,,,
,,,,"THIS PHONE CAUGHT ON FIRE. I TOOK THE BACK OFF TO LOOK AT THE BATTERY .The phone gave a popping sound. I drop it to the floor. It was burning up. My aide ran in my room. "" Quote (hurry let me take this outside it can blow up. }She got something to pick it up and went outside and throw it away on the concrete.",,,,,
,,,,Didn’t realize the S meant Spanish. And the voice to text was on. It took a while to interpret the language and be able to turn off the text to voice. Other then that the phone is alright.,,,,,

,,,,"We live in the US and used to spend a lot of time in Canada before the border closing so I wanted a phone that I would be able to use in the US and Canada using two different sim cards, one for each country. This is exactly what I needed and want. I like everything about this phone and have no complaints. Great value, brand new, fully functioning phone. The larger screen size is helpful and the phone fits my hand well. I bought a phone cover and screen protector and added a large memory card and this phone handles all my on the go computing and communicating needs. As soon as the US/Canada border opens again I'll love it even more.",,,,,
,,,,Arrived with “Do not accept if seal is broken” seal being broken & no phone within the package. External shipping box was not damaged and did not appear to be altered.,,,,,

,,,,"This phone says it's unlocked, but I've tried putting three different services on it and none of them are compatible. It's a nice phone and seems to run smoothly, but It's not compatible with any of the phone services I want.",,,,,
,,,,The phone was obvious used previous. There were a ton of Hispanic bookmarks in IE and the phone was auto set up to Spanish. Also this phone was not compatible to straight talk even thought it said it was.

,,,,Got this phone for my mother. started to use it and this phone is really slow. This phone sucks.,,,,,
,,,,This phone is so slow. I regret this purchase. Don't waste your money.,,,,,
,,,,This phone is slow as heck. it takes a while just for it to load the unlock screen when it is already turned on. having more than one app open in the background makes the phone freeze. the only good thing is the camera... and its not great.,,,,,

,,,,Don't know what happened but i received a box with no cell phone!,,,,,
,,,,"The phone itself seemed great but theres no sim card so, I thought an easy way to fix that would be to put my old sim card in it; however, it did not work.

,,,,Got phone. It read my sim card. That's what I needed it to do. It came in Spanish. Had to switch it to English. Which was simple. It's a pretty big phone. Sends pixelated videos in text messages.. and the video has to be 10 seconds or less for me to send it..,,,,,
,,,,This is exactly what I ordered and for that price you really can't go wrong. The best part is it is factory unlocked so all I had to do was put in my old sims card and voila. You really can't go wrong with that price.,,,,,

Because it comes ""unlocked"" I was able to get a Really good deal on an inexpensive plan that also works the same as an expensive one from the big names!! This phone uses hardly any of the battery after a full day of texting and a few calls and several games of Soduko, I still have 89% of my battery juice!! Love this beautiful phone!! Thank you!!!",,,,,

About a month, the phone had vertical lines that started showing up on dark/black background screens. The seller tried helping fix this problem by suggesting things to do. In the end he helped get a full refund for the one phone. Fast responses, no issues with the seller. Seller was great.",,,,,

,,,,"Internacional users, don’t waste your money. 3 months after purchasing the Samsung A10s Unlocked for International use from Lifeline786, the phone isn’t working properly. The screen goes black, doesn’t let you do anything, until it ran out of battery then it could turn back on right after charging it or take a day or two to start. Seller said after the 30 day warranty they offer the window is closed with them. Then if you are outside the USA (main reason why you buy this type of phone) the manufacturer “may or may not cover the Warranty”. Seller didn't offer any type of help to get the problem resolved/fix/repair considering have been only 3 months since it was purchased. After 30 days you are OUT OF LUCK. WHAT A WASTE.",,,,,

,,,,The cellphone overall is a very nice cellphone but it is NOT compatible with American cellphone companies. Can make calls and text. That’s it! Can use any other features.

,,,,"If you want a phone that is easy to use, clear sound, beautiful pictures , stylish AND tough, great battery life and is AFFORDABLE, this is the phone for you. When my Galaxy J3 finally threw in the towel, I tried some new fangled phones, off brands promising better! Faster! Greater! Bigger!! They weren't. They blacked out, quit working for no reason, sounded bad, wouldn't charge, ... so I did what I should have done in the first place... I purchased another Samsung Galaxy Phone. I upgraded my J3 (which I dropped more times than I can remember, and in water at least 30 times😳 before it finally developed a glitch🤣) to this. NOTHING beats a Samsung Galaxy phone. They're easy to use, good cameras, excellent screen area , clear, sharp, vibrant. And tough enough. I'm hard on phones. Galaxy can take it. This is the first time I've tried an international version, and with double Sim capabilities. I turned this phone on , set it on English, put in my AT&T pre paid Sim card i had used in two of the POS phones, and that was it .. no problems at all. This Galaxy phone was well worth the money, as was my Galaxy.phone before it. It has everything that I need and then some. And at an awesome price. I dont live on my phone like a lot of folks do. But I want to be able to count on it when I need to. I wasted somewhere between four and six hundred dollars on crappie POS phones(and one with a service plan I could never quite use). They promise everything and delivered nothing. I will not make that mistake again.",,,,,
,,,,👍,,,,,
,,,,Good quality and very good price,,,,,
,,,,The phone is a beautiful phone. The first one I bought was defective however the seller was willing to replace it. I recommend.,,,,,
,,,,This phone did not work with AT&T as advertised,,,,,
,,,,Defective out of the box. Could not even set the phone up,,,,,
,,,,Very pleased with fast delivery and product...only spanish instructions included could be an issue with some,,,,,
,,,,good,,,,,
,,,,"Decent phone but not kid friendly. Charger port can be easily broken. Make sure it's not forced or bent, when plugged into the charger.",,,,,
,,,,Love thefingerprint reader. Have no problems with the phone,,,,,
,,,,Counterfeit,,,,,
,,,,Perfect delivery,,,,,
,,,,phone will not work with Verizon,,,,,
,,,,Nice phone but Verizon was not able to activate it.,,,,,
,,,,Excellent product love it,,,,,
,,,,It didnt come with all the stuff. I got the same phone before and it has an sd card but i paid to get an sd cars and didnt get one,,,,,
,,,,I like the phone nice came with headphones charger usb and the prepaid SIM card unfortunately I had to return it since I was going to give it to my stepdaughter as a gift but she got a phone so I had to return it,,,,,
,,,,No good for pR,,,,,
,,,,This item was block it wouldnt work.,,,,,
,,,,Terrible phone. Definitely not worth the money. Slow. Touch screen does not respond well to touch. Slow charge. Wish I could return it.,,,,,
,,,,This phone is terrible it is slow amd has no data on it I wouldnt recomend it to anyone,,,,,
,,,,"The telephone I selected, had a clear camera as well as operating speed. However, it would short out and open pages along with sending alerts.",,,,,
,,,,"i bought this phone not realizing that it wont accept 4G and it is a fake phone, i want a refund.",,,,,
,,,,"No trabajo muy bien, solo como por 3 meses y ya no se puede contestar bien las llamadas entre otras fallas.",,,,,
,,,,This is not what they claim it’s a 3G phone it’s ridiculously slow it got a European charger I'm send it it back,,,,,
,,,,Excelente funcionamiento,,,,,
,,,,"Very happy with this phone, no negatives to mention. It does everything i need and it is a great price.",,,,,
,,,,"Cheap and easy-to-use mobile phone with practical functions, dual card dual standby, very good 👍",,,,,
,,,,My personal phone and not real impressed kinda hard to figure out and no book for instruct on how,,,,,
,,,,This phone is easy to use and the security features are great. So far I'm enjoying this phone.,,,,,
,,,,I love my new phone.! Truly worth the price and more.,,,,,
,,,,The camera has stopped working after 1 month.,,,,,
,,,,The worst Amazon purchased product. This cell phone used and buggy as can be It still has the security pass code from the previous owner which prevented me from geting into the phone. Then I tried to do a factory reset using procedures from Samsung and wouldn't engage. The phone isn't working and I will be sending it back.,,,,,
,,,,I looked for a phone for a while. I wanted a good long battery and a lot of memory. This phone is perfect for me. I bought a refurbished phone. Brand new phone. This phone is perfected for me. It has it all.,,,,,
,,,,The A10s is a very good phone. Definitely worth the price. Nice big screen close in size to most high end phones. Screen is good not perfect but very good. Scrolling is nice and smooth most of the time. Colors are good. Not the most capable phone but if you want something simple cheap and big this is the right choice. Speaker is probably the only thing I would complain about. Doesn't have the best sound quality. A nice pair of galaxy buds will fix that. Blue light filter could also be better. Great budget phone.,,,,,
,,,,This phone is a head ache I can't do anything on it,,,,,
,,,,Nice,,,,,
,,,,This phone didn't work well with my phone service! Have to get my daughter a different phone now.,,,,,
,,,,Ordered 2 phones...received none (Im seriously stricken with disappointment) . The Truth.,,,,,
,,,,Phone was shipped to my daughter in a timely manner and looked in good condition,,,,,
,,,,"I would have liked to know that you couldn't use just any phone service with the phone since most services only carry certain styles or numbers. I have to go thru the phone service itself, and it will cost me more for that type if phone.",,,,,
,,,,I really needed a new phone and this was definitely worth the money.,,,,,
,,,,Battery life.,,,,,
,,,,"Got this phone to replace the Motorola G4 I'd been using for a couple of years. After only a couple months, this phone is already slower than my old Motorola. Fingerprint scanner is janky and overall it's just slow. Battery life is normal so far. Should've stuck with Motorola.",,,,,
,,,,Excelente Gracias,,,,,
,,,,I bought this item from this seller and right when I got it the keyboard didn't work then after a month the screen went blank and the phone stopped working,,,,,
,,,,"Came preloaded with some kind of random app that has access to everything and can't be uninstalled, if you value your privacy go elsewhere",,,,,
,,,,Worth it for at&t,,,,,
,,,,"Battery lasts throughout the day. Would've been great if it would wake up by tapping the screen. Still uses that silly microUSB, so no USB C connector.",,,,,
,,,,The phone is strictly international couldn't even change the language,,,,,
,,,,"Good basic phone, a little slow when multiple apps are opened, but really good value for money.",,,,,
,,,,"I had the phone for roughly 6 months and it worked fairly ok at first, then it started running slower and pretty soon it went to crap. I had problems with battery keeping a charge for long periods and it would get slower and slower every week, soon I couldn't download and had to keep cleaning it in order to do anything with it.",,,,,
,,,,"I waited a week to post this feedback , but it's been nice and fun . Easy switch from a galaxy orbit to this one . No problem so far . I really like the phone . nice and simple.",,,,,
,,,,Bought this phone for my dad he was very happy with it and how it works! The phone came just as advertised.,,,,,
,,,,"I am loving this phone,I'm not a big phone person but this is the best one I've gotten for this price range so far.",,,,,
,,,,I bought it for my mother. It worked great. It was easy to configure. She is delighted!!!!!,,,,,
,,,,i liek everyting about it,,,,,
,,,,I love it,,,,,
,,,,"Gran producto, excelente vendedor, lo recomiendo",,,,,
,,,,The description Never said this is an International phone. Can't be used in the USA nice phone though . Bad experience. It was really bad for me because I REALLY liked the phone. In the future be more specific in your comments on the phone. Mention that is an International phone. That's why I gave 1 star... I couldn't do 0 stars.,,,,,
,,,,very slow,,,,,
,,,,I bought this phone for my brother and was planning on giving to him for his birthday since his phone no longer works. Excited to get the phone so I can a surprise him when I go to see him for his birthday and inboxing the phone increased my excitement. The phone is sleek and very easy to hold; until I went to set it up. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOURE USING IT IN THE US. The Phone I received (don’t know if they’re all the same) had NO OPTION TO SELECT ENGLISH AS YOUR LANGUAGE. It starts off with Spanish and has the drop down window to select your language of choice. However NO OPTION FOR ENGLISH. Even though the description says US + International and can be used on T-Mobile network. Plus it had a lot of positive reviews I figured I couldn’t go wrong. Please do not buy if English is your first/only language and you’re planning on using it in the US,,,,,
,,,,"Advertised the camera as very well quality, very slow, and overall is not really a good phone.",,,,,
,,,,"Had to buy a replacement phn., immediately. Not only was this phn. A great price, it was shipped to me in 1 day ! The galaxy products i have used, are excellent! This one has a great, large screen, beautiful pis, i love it !!",,,,,
,,,,"Screen froze after 3 weeks. During initial covid shutdown, could not contact anyone. Return time frame expired. Useless. Purchased 2nd phone, unlocked. Arrived used and locked. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! with this company. Returning 2nd one.",,,,,
,,,,Good,,,,,
,,,,"Just a few days after receiving this product the screen would go blank in the middle of sending a text message, surfing the net or on a call. Restarting the phone helps sometimes but sometimes not at all. I messaged the seller to ask why this was so but never got a response. So I am stuck with a phone that is not usable.",,,,,
,,,,Todo bien,,,,,
,,,,"Many dual SIM phones have only two card slots, one for a SIM and one that can be used for either a second SIM or a microSD card, but not both. This phone has three slots in its card tray, two for nano SIMs plus a dedicated microSD slot, so no sacrifice is necessary. Has an FM radio chip and includes wired ear buds to use as an antenna. Minimal bloatware, only thing I'd like to delete but can't is Facebook. Flashlight is super bright but only has one brightness level, 100%, unlike my previous Samsung which had four. No magnetic compass sensor, which is no biggie with GPS or if you can determine heading from the sun, moon, and time. No NFC so no support for contactless payment. Speaker location on the bottom edge to the left of the Micro USB port is unfortunate... my natural operating mode is left handed using the thumb to type and little finger to balance the phone, which blocks the speaker. Speaker is also blocked if I hold the phone against my body to stabilize. Speaker is plenty loud and sounds great. Wish it had a USB Type C port and quick charging capability. Display is very sharp, plenty bright. Software supports pretty much any language on the planet... at first turn-on, Español is the default, so pull down to US English if that's your preference. Easy peasy. No problems getting it to work on Metro by T-Mobile... just have to register the IMEI through one of their flirty customer service call center reps, who will waive the $15 fee if you go that route instead of taking it to a store. Had I asked for her number, she probably would have shot back with 611 LOL! Anyway, love the glossy red finish. 2 GB is a little light these days, but I've always used lower end phones so knowing how to minimize RAM footprint is second nature. No problems yet. Overall, not disappointed. I would buy again.",,,,,
,,,,"On screen Does not rotate 360° It is very slippery to hold. Comes with Samsung Internet browser, which I never used. Transferred all my iPhone photos and music. But dropped transfer of many Facebook contacts.",,,,,
,,,,Best Buy,,,,,
,,,,Will not work on Verizon network. My first time use Amazon and my LAST time I will use Amazon. Not refunding the money is the same as stealing. Being a theft is why I will never use Amazon again. No Star for Amazon,,,,,
,,,,"Love it, just the finger sensor is off",,,,,
,,,,"Item was as espectro, am happy",,,,,
,,,,"I don't know if the issues I'm having with this phone is due to the fact that it was used or if it's because the a10s is just not a great phone. The camera and the flash are out of sync. When I need the flash to take a picture the flash goes off before the picture is taken and the picture quality is not very good. My Galaxy s9 takes great pictures. Also, I have to tap on icons several times to get the phone to react. I'm going to return this phone and buy another s9. The finger print reader works fine, the battery life is very good, and the face recognition is functional. But the other issues make this a sub par phone in my opinion.",,,,,
,,,,This phone is great. It made a lot of things easy for me and for the price you can believe it was worth it.,,,,,
,,,,"Was told it was unlocked and was compatible with our carrier. That is only reason we bought for our son for Christmas. Now I am sitting here with customer service trying to return it , because it is NOT compatible nor unlocked for Straight talk. Merry Christmas smh",,,,,
,,,,This phone was not unlocked...,,,,,
,,,,Dont get signal in most place.,,,,,
,,,,"I don't really write reviews. This is my first long review. I spent countless hours trying to find a budget Friendly Quality phone. The camera quality is pretty great in (good lighting). I like that it has portrait mode. This phone is not small, it is just Slim but I have a phone case & screen protector. The screen is big and pretty. Ive had this phone about 2-3 months & hace dropped possibly over a handful of times and no cracks. Sound quality is okay, not the Loudest. The battery is good, it can last all day Maybe two depending on phone usage. Im on my phone frequently and last me all day if full charge. It can also take a while to charge. If you live in the U.S. you may have to call your phone carrier customer line or in store to activate your IMEI to their Network in order to get phone service. I wasted about 2 days trying to do it myself 🤦🏽‍♀️ when i couldve just called customer Service and got it activated in less than 5-10 minutes. Also this phone is compatible with MOST GSM carriers NOT all, (Ex. Metro PCS, T-Mobile). It is not compatible with CDMA carriers (Ex. Verizon, Sprint). It tells us in the description box. Most importantly review the company reviews you plan to purchase the phone from so you can have an idea of what youre getting yourself into. All in all I am highly satisfied with my phone.",,,,,
,,,,Misleading description. It is not compatible with Verizon or able to be used. Charges a 20% return feee for their misleading post and makes you ship them back from their error. Do not buy this product.,,,,,
,,,,Worked great for a month. Now two months (February) in and it doesn't charge or holds charge.,,,,,
,,,,"I received this phone a few days ago. So far so good. I received it in a timely manner and in the condition as described. No scratches or cracked screen on phone, no messed up packaging. The phone takes good pics, can be personalized to your liking of course. The only negatives I've noticed thus far is that the phone was programmed in Espanol which I'm not fluent in at all. But I was able to work my through it and program it to English. Also I couldn't get the facial recognition to work when I first tried it but I'll reattempt again later. Also please not this phone has 3 compartments for sims card. All in all I'm pleased thus far and would likely purchase from this company again.",,,,,
,,,,This mobile was completely useless,,,,,
,,,,Does not work in the US and is completely useless. This is a issue that should be in the main description of the ad. Not close to the end of ad. Very disappointed in Amazon and this phone,,,,,
,,,,"As of May 2021 the phone has ended up shutting down and won't turn on again. NO support from Ubreakit, Best Buy or AT&T will help. I'll end up just having to buy a brand new phone.",,,,,
,,,,Shipment reach quickly,,,,,
,,,,PHONE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH BASIC US NETWORKS.,,,,,
,,,,Great quality and fast shipping,,,,,
,,,,AWFUL for the money i will not buy this again,,,,,
,,,,Price and quality was very good.,,,,,
,,,,"It is a Christmas present so I'm only rating for what I can see. I'll update later after the person gets and uses it for a little bit, so I can say Truthfully the likes/dislikes(if any). First!! I got it Super Fast! The protection filler ( for lack of a better word ), could have been a little better! It has 2 (what I call blow up pillows) One was deflated the other one was fine, but in my opinion 2 is not good enough even on regular days, much less Christmas time where things are super crazy and not handled with the best of care!( I used to work in a Post Office! AND delivered mail bags/packages to other Post Offices! SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT)! That being said, when I opened the package the Phone box was in pristine condition! The phone has a heavy feel to it. And that is Great by me. I hope it means it can take a beating until she picks out a case for it.LOL. The screen is a lot bigger than what she has now and bigger than I thought it would be! She has "" fingerprint reader "" on her phone now and loves it so I think I hit it out the park with fingerprint And face recognition!! I'm giving the Phone 5 stars for what I can tell as of now. Like I said I will update a little later. UPDATE: Longer than a couple of weeks ( sorry ). I have to say this is an Awesome phone!!! It is so much better than I was expecting for the price. And she has even dropped it a few times ( before she got a phone case for it ), and no damage at all!! I was floored to say the least! I expected a cracked screen or something, but nothing. So if you want a phone that has it all (in my opinion), great volume, nice feel, AND you don't have to worry about being gentle with it, then all I can say is ""I don't think you'll go wrong buying this one"" . I know I'm very grateful I did.",,,,,
,,,,Vino con defecto en la carga,,,,,
,,,,Wonderful,,,,,
,,,,"Didn’t work. Said no sim, but the sim chip was in it. Sent back and still waiting on refund.",,,,,
,,,,"I have been through 2 of these phones now and they won't make or receive calls through straight talk..the KICKER is..ATT can't activate it either! Text and data work fine, but I didn't buy a tablet..",,,,,
,,,,So far the phone is working. The finger print is working well and the battery life is good. However I would advise you not to purchase from Cell Universal. I purchased a new phone for my mom. First thing I notice was a dark fog on the bottom of the screen. This damage I'm sure will get worst. I'm very disappointed!!! Don't buy!!,,,,,
,,,,Very nice phone,,,,,
,,,,I was sold a faulty phone. It doesnt connect to the wifi. It appeared after the 30 days so i cant return it. Dont waste your money.,,,,,
,,,,It doesn't call or have any information on how to set up the phone on how to get it to work?????? It wont give any information on which carrier it's from?,,,,,
,,,,Battery is really good . Long time,,,,,
,,,,El celular no está desbloqueado para Estados Unidos.,,,,,
,,,,Buen teléfono no tan rápido pero por el precio esta bien para un adulto mayor que no exija velocidad,,,,,
,,,,Old was s7 lol,,,,,
,,,,I dislike this phone. Why doesnt it have front flash? Camera on a whole is poor,,,,,
,,,,Works great so far!,,,,,
,,,,"Phone battery and fingerprint reader are great, the problem I have with this phone is how slow it is. The phone's touch screen is horrible. I set an alarm and couldn't turn it off due to the faulty screen, had to reset the phone. The phone constantly lags when trying to play videos. Maybe I just got a faulty product? Sure I can accept that, but I find that hard to believe since a refurbished product is usually tested.",,,,,
,,,,Yes,,,,,
,,,,Very good phone,,,,,
,,,,i love the size of the phone i bought it for my 56 year old dad for his Christmas however it was a lil difficult to set up in terms of the different features i would imagine someone who is not technologically savvy having difficulties setting it up had issues with the touchscreen too,,,,,
,,,,"Good phone. Just accidentally ordered 2 phones when I only wanted 1 phone. I am returning 1 phone, which I did NOT even open. Thanks.",,,,,
,,,,"This phone sucks, it will not connect to any internet and even when I try to use my phone service, it will not update anything and when I took it to see if I could get help with it they couldn't figure it out, I wont get this phone agian",,,,,
,,,,It is not an unlocked phone and does not work with any carrier!,,,,,
,,,,Will use every day until StraightTalk makes it obsolete...,,,,,
,,,,I love phone hate that didn't come with a charger.,,,,,
,,,,Phone broke after two months. Screen went out.,,,,,
,,,,This phone does not work on any carriers in the U.S it sucks,,,,,
,,,,Don't buy this phone. Its not what it seems to be.,,,,,
,,,,"This is my second Samsung galaxy a10S. They are great phones, I just happened to smash my first one, so I ended up ordering the same phone again. This time I recieved a Spanish version of this phone. Getting it set up was a pain but once I got it switched to English and my sim card worked I figured it would be fine. I'm a few weeks into using the phone and it is clear that this phone does not work as well as my previous phone of the same make and model. I contacted customer service in hopes I could get a replacement, but they said i would have to return this phone and order again. Right now I don't have a spare phone to use and can't afford to order another phone before I get my refund, so I'm basically stuck with this knock off. Just wish I got what I ordered",,,,,
,,,,After 1.5 months the screen came out. This my first time to see that happen with any cellphone,,,,,
,,,,Love it! Great video quality and sound.,,,,,
,,,,Not terribly expensive and had tons of room for everything.,,,,,
,,,,"No me agado El equipo no funciona,no me permite uilizar INTERNET. GRACIAS",,,,,
,,,,Good quality for the money spent.,,,,,
,,,,Ok Budget phone,,,,,
,,,,Very satisfied. The only draw back is the lack of a slow motion videoing capability.,,,,,
,,,,Junk. Waste of money. Super slow. Garbage camera. Do not buy.,,,,,
,,,,Purchased on February 3 20 and won't charge now three months,,,,,
,,,,Good phone for a good price. My son loves it.,,,,,
,,,,NOT UNLOCKED FOR STRAIGHTTALK IN THE USA,,,,,
,,,,Piece of junk with scamming apps from Mexico pre installed. Worst phone I have ever owned.,,,,,
,,,,"Good works, betterytiming good",,,,,
,,,,"Phone's default settings are in Spanish with voice assistant enabled. Once you get past changing those settings (not as easy as it should have been but definitely doable) the phone is awesome. If you're a Samsung user you'll probably like this phone, it really reminds me of the S8 with the fingerprint reader on the back. It was purchased as a gift for a non smart phone user & she loves it!",,,,,
,,,,"I was looking for new cell phones for both my wife and myself. I purchased this A10s because it was a unlocked phone. Right from the beginning I have been very pleased with it. It has a great screen, dynamic colors and great sound quality. This is the one I bought for my wife and she loves it.",,,,,
,,,,"Good quality, happy with the phone. Only bad thing is the shipping took a loooooong time.",,,,,
,,,,Samsung Android phone you get what you pay for it gets the job done just understand the specs of the phone your buying don’t expect a flagship galaxy but a workhorse none the less,,,,,
,,,,Was satisfied with features and storage of device compared to last owned device,,,,,
,,,,Great phone for the money,,,,,
,,,,Was stated as an unlocked phone whereas in fact received the phone as a locked phone. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.,,,,,
,,,,"I havnt tried the face recognition the phone is decentyou get what you pay for. Personally mine has a few glitches and im no tech so i deal with it. Also i got this bc it said it was compatible with page plus and it was not so i jad to change to att prepaid and ive already had an issue paying my first bill The phone looks nice and i love red but my j3 gave me less problems. Oh and when i got it everything was in spanish, simple fix and it was easy to transfer ev4 everything from my old phone.",,,,,
,,,,Don't buy from this seller had the phone for 3 months and it stopped working. I sent it to samsung they they wanted to charge me to fix it because you guys wouldn't take back the phone,,,,,
,,,,It was a good price but it was tough to get going and then transfer all my data. I still don't have all of my voicemails.,,,,,
,,,,purchased 2 of these. took both to 2 different providers and was told by both that these will not work in united states. been waiting 2 weeks for refund! starting to think scam!!,,,,,
,,,,Works really great period if you need basic fun usage that would be the one. Very affordable and great quality,,,,,
,,,,Love it,,,,,
,,,,Very easy to set up and use.,,,,,
,,,,Very fast processor and so much memory. I love the size and picture quality. I can take great pictures and videos like a professional now thanks to the self stability.,,,,,
,,,,"Overall the phone feels very cheap and loads slowly. The biggest problem though was that it is a 3g umts phone, which means it did not recognise my verizon SIM card. Product has been returned.",,,,,
,,,,"It's ok, the brightness is not as my other phone and it's hard sometimes to scan your finger. But I can't complain for the price. It does what it needs to.",,,,,
,,,,I love my new phone thank you,,,,,
,,,,"The phone works for basic calls and text but there is no mobile data which means no internet unless you are on wi-fi. It also means no MMS messages so no sending or receiving pictures. We've tried ATT and T Mobile. I bought two of these last year for my husband and daughter and they were/are fine. So I ordered one for Christmas for my mom (hit reorder on the one I bought for my husband). It took my mom a while to realize that it didn't give her MMS messages. So I ate the $150 bucks because it was too late to return. Hit reorder on the phone for my daughter, got the international phone again. This time I'm returning right away.",,,,,
,,,,Love this phone. It is really nice. May get another for a girl.,,,,,
,,,,Muy buen producto,,,,,
,,,,I'm really excited about the phone but I've yet to use it because it doesn't have a regular sim card. You have to poke like a needle in a very tiny hole. I don't have that because of my ms and the way my hand shakes. I personally don't like sharp or pointy things around me. I'm going to order a needle and try it so it should be working soon. I like the sharpness of the images.,,,,,
,,,,"It's a true dual sim phone, in that it has slots for 2 sims AND a dedicated mem-card, exactly what my dad wanted for an upgrade from his old dual sim phone. I saw a lot of reviews here that they can't understand the language, the 1st time i started the phone the 1st option is to select a language, which is defaulted on Spanish. (it's rather small and can be missed if you rush through the 1st time setup). i got no complains here, my dad is old he wasn't looking for a fast phone or anything, just to upgrade from his old phone. i have to say, price wise this is a pretty good.",,,,,
,,,,Love the phone! It was everything and more than I expected.,,,,,
,,,,The imei doesnt match phone to set it up and if you do manage calls or txt data is absolutely unavailable!,,,,,
,,,,My bank accounts and Facebook was hacked using this phone it was most likely tampered with it wouldn't store anything to the memory card everything would only store to the phone it was slow to catch up when I 1st got it which I should have noticed something then the box was in Spanish I didn't pay attention to not that its a problem but it didn't make sense to me I couldn't get any txt msg to verify my accounts connected to my phone number someone had been in my phone for a while whoever is selling this phone may be a hacker,,,,,
,,,,Nothing,,,,,
,,,,Me encanta y el precio ni hablar,,,,,
,,,,"I wanted to use this phone as it arrived in fine condition, but T Mobile could not activate it because it is strictly an international phone. It says US and international and I was disappointed because it would have been perfect. I would like to order another if compatible with US network but can't get any response. Why import a phone that only works internationally?",,,,,
,,,,I use this for my kids to talk to grandparents. Not much used but serves the purpose.,,,,,
,,,,"This phone is really nice and fast, but seems to have that camera issue I keep hearing about from samsung's. I did everything samsung said to fix the camera not working properly and still nothing. Camera will not let you take a picture unless you are in a App and do it that way like through messenger. Aside from that its a great phone, but I cannot give it more stars with a fisher price quality camera.",,,,,
,,,,"Don't use the fingerprint reader, head problems with the face recognition, but I heard there is an update to fix that. Battery life is good.",,,,,
,,,,"Not compatible for US cellular, who's been my provider for 6 years! Sucks",,,,,
,,,,Nice celephone. Face recognition,,,,,
,,,,"I dont like that the Camara stop working after 3 days and this is my second phone, seller did and exchange which was great but the same issue with second phone after 3 day camara stop working.. I really don't have the energy for this nonsense so I bought a camara app off google play store..",,,,,
,,,,Awesome phone. Set up was easy and I have had no issues since with the exception of the memory card it came with. The card kept unmounting itself and has cleared all my data twice. So I threw it away. Initially I thought something was wrong with the card tray but I inserted a new memory card and I now have no issues.,,,,,
,,,,"for the price, you cant go wrong",,,,,
,,,,If you are in the U.S do not buy this phone it is not made for the U.S. Nice phone but only has 2-3G gets bad reception and poor internet service if you are in the U.S.,,,,,
,,,,Just wondering if the headphones are supposed to be like this as the sides are different lengths.,,,,,
,,,,Me llego completamente nuevo sin ningún tipo de uso con cargador y audífonos y está desbloqueado para cualquier parte del mundo funciona la huella el reconocimiento fácil y todo me encanta! Fue un regalo para mi mamá,,,,,
,,,,"Was programed for a different country. operated in foreign language, same with manual, doesn't pick up 4G. Should not be sold in this country.",,,,,
,,,,Works great.,,,,,
,,,,Battery life,,,,,
,,,,Great phone. I've had it for over 3 months and I think it's great. It's more sleek than I expected so I'm happy with the purchase.,,,,,
,,,,Although this phone was nice when hooked up to wifi. It will not work on American Networks. And can't be used off of a wifi connection.I had to return it.,,,,,
,,,,fast delivery but it doesn't work with Sprint/T-mobile. The IMEI is not in their system. The phone goes back to the seller.,,,,,
,,,,my mother loved the product it was a Mother's Day Gift,,,,,
,,,,If you're just wanting to have a good dependable phone that does most possible functions a person could need and you don't have to refinance your home to buy it or get tied to a contract until your grandchildren are old and gray. This phone is perfect,,,,,
,,,,"the phone works fine, as long as you don't need a camera. I got it to replace my kids phone that she lost while in college. but the time I found out it was faulty, she was already home (in a different country) and returning it wasn't an option.",,,,,
,,,,Not happy. Phone was not compatible with Verizon as I was led to believe it was.,,,,,
,,,,"Ordered a phone. The only problem, there was no phone in the box!",,,,,
,,,,When I order this there was nothing said that it could not be activated by my carrier due to the fact it was an international set and not supported by my carrier,,,,,
,,,,"Buen producto con una buana calidad,y responsabilidad al entregar .",,,,,
,,,,Fast shipping battery life 12hours,,,,,
,,,,The product was not factory unlocked as advertised. The IMEI number was not a recognized number for Sprint to use.,,,,,
,,,,This product is an absolutely no use to me since it cannot work with a Verizon plan. I am thoroughly disgusted and disappointed with this product that I can now not return because I miss the window of January 31. I have tried many different ways to get it to work and it was only when I went to the Verizon store that they informed me that it is not compatible with Verizon wireless service. So I have $130 phone that I can now use as a paper weight!,,,,,
,,,,I received my phone in 2 days! For the price you can't beat it. I have zero complaints. The phone is brand new and no signs of wear. Super clear screen and battery life is good. I have metro pcs and it was very easy to set it up with customer service.,,,,,
,,,,The phone makes great gifts!! I bought four of them for gifts and the recipients are pleased with them!!!,,,,,
,,,,Not compatible through Verizon. Didn't receive calls of texts with ATT.,,,,,
